                <p class="lead">As men get older, body changes are natural. For many men over 50 in Nepal, one of the
                    most common
                    changes
                    involves the prostate gland. This condition is called Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia
                    (BPH).
                </p>

                <p class="lead">While the medical name sounds complicated, it simply means you have an enlarged
                    prostate. The most
                    important
                    thing to know is that BPH is <em>not</em> cancer. However, it can cause uncomfortable symptoms that
                    disrupt
                    your daily routine.</p>

                <p class="lead">If you are worried about your symptoms, a doctor consultation at Maria Hospital
                    can give you
                    the
                    answers you need.</p>

                    Enlarged prostate is a common age-related condition in men over 50. BPH can cause urinary discomfort
                    and affect daily
                    life, but proper diagnosis and treatment can bring relief.

            <section>
                <h2>What is the Prostate?</h2>
                <p>The prostate is a small gland, about the size of a walnut. It is found just below the bladder and
                    wraps
                    around the tube that carries urine out of the body (the urethra).</p>
                <p>When the prostate grows too large, it squeezes this tube. Imagine stepping on a garden hose—the water
                    flows
                    slowly or stops. This is exactly what happens to your urine flow when you have BPH.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Is BPH the Same as Prostate Cancer?</h2>
                <p><strong>No.</strong> BPH is benign, which means it is non-cancerous. Having an enlarged prostate does
                    not
                    increase your risk of getting prostate cancer.</p>
                <p>However, because BPH and prostate cancer can have similar warning signs, you should never ignore
                    them. A
                    proper diagnosis by a specialist is the only way to be sure.</p>
            </section>

                <figcaption>
                    In benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), the prostate grows larger and presses on the urethra, much
                    like stepping on a
                    garden hose. This narrowing explains symptoms such as weak urine stream and incomplete bladder
                    emptying.

                <h2>Who is at Risk?</h2>
                <p>BPH is a normal part of aging for most men.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Age:</strong> By age 60, half of all men will notice signs. By age 85, nearly 90% of men
                        are
                        affected.</li>
                    <li><strong>Family History:</strong> If your father or brother had prostate issues, you might too.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Factors like weight, heart health, and diabetes can play a role.
                    </li>

            <section>
                <h2>Common Symptoms to Watch For</h2>
                <p>Symptoms can be different for every man. You might have a very large prostate but few symptoms, or a
                    slightly
                    enlarged one with major issues. Look out for these "Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms":</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Frequent Urination:</strong> Needing to visit the toilet often, especially waking up
                        multiple
                        times at night.</li>
                    <li><strong>Urgency:</strong> A sudden need to pee that is hard to control.</li>
                    <li><strong>Weak Stream:</strong> Urine flow that is slow or stops and starts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Straining:</strong> Having to push hard to start urinating.</li>
                    <li><strong>Incomplete Emptying:</strong> Feeling like your bladder is still full after you finish.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <aside>
                    <p><strong>Emergency Note:</strong> If you cannot pass any urine at all, this is an emergency called
                        <em>urinary retention</em>. Please seek immediate medical help.
                    </p>

                <figcaption>
                    Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) occurs when the prostate enlarges and narrows the urethra, making
                    it difficult for
                    urine to pass freely from the bladder. Early diagnosis helps prevent worsening urinary symptoms.

                <h2>Treatment Options at Maria Hospital</h2>
                <p>You do not have to live with these symptoms. There are many effective ways to treat BPH, ranging from
                    simple
                    habit changes to advanced medical procedures. Your specific treatment plan will depend on your
                    health and
                    the size of your prostate.</p>

                <article>
                    <h3>1. Lifestyle Changes</h3>
                    <p>If your symptoms are mild, your doctor might suggest "watchful waiting." Simple changes can help:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Drink less coffee and alcohol.</li>
                        <li>Exercise regularly.</li>
                        <li>Avoid drinking liquids right before bed.</li>
                    </ul>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>2. Medications</h3>
                    <p>For moderate symptoms, medicine is often the first step.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Relaxers (Alpha-blockers):</strong> These help relax muscles in the prostate to make
                            peeing
                            easier.</li>
                        <li><strong>Shrinkers (5-Alpha Reductase Inhibitors):</strong> These help stop the prostate from
                            growing
                            or make it smaller.</li>
                    </ul>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>3. Minimally Invasive & Surgical Procedures</h3>
                    <p>If medicine is not enough, Maria Hospital offers modern surgical solutions. We prioritize
                        techniques that
                        offer quick recovery and safety.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>TURP (The Gold Standard):</strong> This is the most common surgery where the inner
                            part of
                            the prostate is trimmed away to restore urine flow. Modern bipolar TURP is safer and very
                            effective.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Laser Surgery:</strong> Uses high-energy lasers to vaporize excess tissue with less
                            bleeding
                            and faster healing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Minimally Invasive Therapies:</strong> Options like water vapor therapy or prostate
                            lifts
                            can open the urinary pathway without major surgery.</li>
                        <li><strong>Open Surgery:</strong> Reserved for very large prostates to remove the obstruction
                            completely.</li>
                    </ul>
