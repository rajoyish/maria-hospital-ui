                <p class="lead">Is urinating becoming painful or difficult? You are not alone. Many men in Nepal suffer
                    silently from
                    prostate issues, often fearing the worst.</p>
                <p class="lead">At <strong>Maria Hospital</strong>, we want you to know the facts. The condition is
                    likely
                    Prostatitis—swelling of the prostate gland. It is very common, especially in men under 50. Most
                    importantly,
                    it is not cancer, and having it does not increase your risk of getting cancer.</p>
                <p class="lead">If you are looking for a reliable doctor consultation in Kathmandu in Nepal,
                    understanding your
                    symptoms is
                    the first step toward relief.</p>

                    Pain or burning during urination, groin discomfort, and pelvic pain are common signs of prostatitis.
                    With proper
                    diagnosis and timely treatment, prostatitis can be effectively managed and relieved.

                <h2>What is Prostatitis?</h2>
                <p>The prostate is a small, walnut-sized gland located just below your bladder. When it becomes inflamed
                    or
                    swollen, it is called Prostatitis.</p>
                <p>Doctors usually classify it into four types:</p>

                <dl>
                    <dt><strong>Acute Bacterial Prostatitis</strong></dt>
                    <dd>A sudden bacterial infection with severe symptoms.</dd>

                    <dt><strong>Chronic Bacterial Prostatitis</strong></dt>
                    <dd>An infection that keeps coming back over time.</dd>

                    <dt><strong>Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CPPS)</strong></dt>
                    <dd>The most common type. It causes long-term pain in the pelvic area, even without an infection.
                    </dd>

                    <dt><strong>Asymptomatic</strong></dt>
                    <dd>You have inflammation but feel no pain. This is usually found during a routine health checkup.
                    </dd>
                </dl>
            </section>

                    alt="Medical illustration of the male pelvic anatomy showing the bladder, prostate gland, urethra, seminal vesicles, penis, testicle, rectum, and nearby lymph nodes, highlighting the location of the prostate." />
                <figcaption>
                    The prostate gland sits just below the bladder and surrounds the urethra. When the prostate becomes
                    inflamed, a
                    condition known as prostatitis, it can cause urinary problems and pain in the pelvic and groin area.
                    Understanding this
                    anatomy helps explain common symptoms and guides effective treatment.

                    diagnosis
                    and checkup:</p>

                <h3>1. Urinary Issues</h3>

                    <strong>⚠️ Emergency Warning:</strong> If you have a sudden fever, chills, body aches, and cannot
                    urinate
                    at all,
                    seek immediate medical help. This could be a severe infection.

            <section>
                <h2>What Causes It?</h2>
                <p>The cause depends on the type of prostatitis you have:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bacteria:</strong> Common bacteria (like <em>E. coli</em>) can enter the prostate from
                        the
                        urinary tract.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stress & Tension:</strong> Emotional stress or tight muscles in the pelvic floor can
                        trigger
                        pain.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Spicy food, alcohol, or injury can sometimes irritate the area.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li><strong>Urine Tests:</strong> To check for bacteria.</li>

                <h2>Effective Treatment Options</h2>
                <p>The good news is that Prostatitis is treatable. Your treatment plan will depend on your specific
                    condition:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Medication:</strong> Antibiotics are very effective for bacterial infections.
                        Alpha-blockers can
                        help relax muscles to make urinating easier.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pain Relief:</strong> Simple medicines (like ibuprofen) can reduce swelling and pain.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Physical Therapy:</strong> Specialized massage or exercises can relax tight pelvic
                        muscles.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Lifestyle Changes:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>Diet:</em> Avoid too much alcohol, caffeine, and very spicy foods.</li>
                            <li><em>Hydration:</em> Drink plenty of water to flush out your system.</li>
                            <li><em>Comfort:</em> If you sit for long periods (like office work or driving), use a
                                cushion to
                                reduce pressure.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
