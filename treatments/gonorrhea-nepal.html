                <p class="lead">Gonorrhea is a very common sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by bacteria. In
                    Nepal, many
                    people may
                    feel shy talking about sexual health, but understanding this infection is vital for your well-being.
                    It
                    spreads easily and can infect both men and women.</p>

                <p class="lead">The good news is that Gonorrhea is fully curable. However, if left untreated, it can
                    cause permanent
                    health
                    problems. If you are worried about your sexual health, a <strong>private doctor
                        consultation</strong> at
                    Maria Hospital can provide the answers you need.

                <figcaption>
                    With timely diagnosis and proper antibiotic treatment, gonorrhea is completely curable. Early
                    testing, partner
                    treatment, and medical guidance help restore health, protect fertility, and give couples peace of
                    mind.

                <h2>How Do You Get Gonorrhea?</h2>
                <p>Gonorrhea is spread through sexual contact. You can get the infection by having vaginal, anal, or
                    oral sex
                    without protection (like a condom).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sexual Fluids:</strong> The bacteria live in fluids like semen and vaginal discharge.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Mother to Baby:</strong> A pregnant woman can pass the infection to her newborn during
                        childbirth.</li>
                    <li><strong>What does NOT spread it:</strong> You cannot get Gonorrhea from hugging, kissing,
                        sharing food,
                        or sitting on toilet seats.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>The "Silent" Infection: Watch for These Symptoms</h2>
                <p>Many people—especially women—do not show any symptoms at all. You can look healthy and still pass the
                    infection to others. If symptoms do appear, they usually start within two weeks.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img class="rounded-xl" src="/images/treatments/gonorrhea/male-female-reproductive.avif"

                    <figcaption>
                        Gonorrhea can infect the reproductive organs of both men and women, often without obvious
                        symptoms. Understanding male
                        and female reproductive anatomy highlights how untreated infection can spread, cause
                        complications, and affect
                        fertility—making early testing and treatment essential.

                <h3>Symptoms in Women</h3>
                <p>Symptoms can often feel like a normal bladder infection. Watch out for:</p>
                <ul>

                    <li>Unusual vaginal discharge (white, yellow, or greenish).</li>
                    <li>Vaginal bleeding between periods.</li>

                </ul>

                <h3>Symptoms in Men</h3>
                <p>Men are more likely to notice signs, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A burning feeling when urinating.</li>
                    <li>White, yellow, or green discharge (pus) from the penis.</li>
                    <li>Painful or swollen testicles.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Symptoms in Other Body Parts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rectum (Anus):</strong> Itching, discharge, or pain.</li>
                    <li><strong>Throat:</strong> Sore throat or swollen glands.</li>
                    <li><strong>Eyes:</strong> Redness, pain, or sensitivity to light.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Diagnosis: How to Know for Sure</h2>
                <p>You cannot guess if you have Gonorrhea based on feelings alone. The only way to know is to get a
                    professional
                    <strong>health checkup</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>At <strong>Maria Hospital</strong>, <strong>Kathmandu in Nepal</strong>, we offer confidential
                    testing
                    methods:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Urine Test:</strong> A simple sample of your urine is checked for bacteria.</li>
                    <li><strong>Swab Test:</strong> A doctor gently takes a sample from the infected area (like the
                        throat or
                        cervix).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Who should get tested?</h3>
                <p>If you are sexually active, we recommend a regular checkup, especially if you have a new partner or
                    multiple
                    partners.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Treatment and Cure</h2>
                <p>Yes, Gonorrhea is curable! Because the bacteria are strong, you need the right medical
                    <strong>treatment</strong>.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Antibiotics:</strong> Your doctor will usually give you an injection (shot) and
                        sometimes oral
                        pills.</li>
                    <li><strong>Treating Partners:</strong> Your sexual partners from the last 60 days must also get
                        tested and
                        treated to stop the infection from coming back.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wait to have sex:</strong> You should avoid sexual contact for seven days after
                        finishing your
                        medication.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="bg-info/10 border-info border-l-4 p-3"><strong>Important:</strong> Always finish all your
                    medicine, even
                    if you feel better. This
                    ensures
                    the infection is completely gone.</p>

                <h2>Why You Should Not Ignore It</h2>
                <p>If you do not get a <strong>diagnosis</strong> and treatment, Gonorrhea can cause serious damage to
                    your
                    body:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Infertility:</strong> In both men and women, untreated Gonorrhea can damage the
                        reproductive
                        organs, making it difficult or impossible to have children later.</li>
                    <li><strong>PID:</strong> Women can develop Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), which is painful and
                        dangerous.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pregnancy Risks:</strong> Mothers can pass the infection to babies, leading to blindness
                        or
                        severe blood infections in the newborn.</li>
                    <li><strong>HIV Risk:</strong> Having untreated Gonorrhea increases your risk of getting HIV.</li>
