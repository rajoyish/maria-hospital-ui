                    information. One of the most common health concerns we see is
                    <strong>Trichomoniasis</strong> (often called "trich").

                    Trichomoniasis spreads through sexual contact and often causes no

                    simple antibiotic treatment can fully cure the infection and protect
                    both partners’ health.

                <h2>What is Trichomoniasis?</h2>
                <p>
                    Trichomoniasis is a very common Sexually Transmitted Infection
                    (STI). It is caused by a tiny parasite. The most important thing to
                    remember is that <strong>it is completely curable</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While it is easily treated with medication, if you ignore it, the
                    infection can last for months or even years.

                    Trichomoniasis is caused by a microscopic parasite called
                    Trichomonas vaginalis. Although invisible to the naked eye, this
                    organism can cause irritation, discharge, and discomfort. With
                    proper testing and antibiotic treatment, the infection is completely
                    curable.

                <p>
                    The parasite passes from one person to another during sexual
                    contact.

                        <strong>How you get it:</strong> Through vaginal, anal, or oral
                        sex, or close skin-to-skin genital contact.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>How you do NOT get it:</strong> You cannot catch it from
                        hugging, kissing, sharing plates, or sitting on toilet seats.

                <p>
                    This infection is tricky because
                    <strong>most people (about 70%) do not have any symptoms</strong>.
                    You might have the infection and feel perfectly healthy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If symptoms do appear, they usually show up 5 to 28 days after
                    exposure.
                </p>

                        Trichomoniasis can cause inflammation of the cervix, sometimes
                        appearing as a “strawberry cervix” with small red spots. This
                        finding helps doctors diagnose the infection, which is fully
                        curable with timely antibiotic treatment and partner management.

                <h2>Why You Should Get Treated</h2>
                <p>
                    Even if you feel fine, untreated Trichomoniasis can lead to serious
                    health issues:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Pregnancy Risks:</strong> It can cause babies to be born
                        too early or with low birth weight.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Higher HIV Risk:</strong> It causes inflammation that
                        makes it easier to catch HIV or pass it to others.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Infertility:</strong> Without treatment, it can lead to
                        complications that make it harder to have children later.

                <h2>Diagnosis and Treatment at Maria Hospital</h2>
                <p>
                    You cannot diagnose this infection just by guessing. A proper
                    <strong>health checkup</strong> is necessary.
                </p>

                <h3>1. The Test</h3>
                <p>
                    Our lab in <strong>Kathmandu</strong> uses accurate testing methods.
                    A doctor will take a fluid sample (using a swab) or a urine sample.
                    It is quick, private, and painless.
                </p>

                <h3>2. The Cure</h3>
                <p>
                    The treatment is simple: oral antibiotics prescribed by a doctor.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Medication:</strong> Usually a 7-day course of pills for
                        women, or a single dose for men.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Treat Partners:</strong> Your partner must get treated at
                        the same time, or you will likely pass the infection back and
                        forth.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Wait:</strong> Avoid sex for about one week until the
                        medicine is finished and symptoms are gone.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="border-l-4 border-warning bg-warning/10 p-3">
                    <strong>Important Warning:</strong> Do not drink alcohol while
                    taking this medication and for at least 24 hours after finishing it.
                    Mixing alcohol with these antibiotics can cause severe vomiting.

                    <li>
                        <strong>It does not prove cheating:</strong> You or your partner
                        could have carried the infection for a long time without knowing.
