                    Do you sometimes leak urine when you cough, sneeze, or laugh? If

                    Urinary incontinence (unwanted bladder leakage) is a very common
                    condition. It affects nearly 25% to 45% of adult women. Despite how
                    common it is, many women in Nepal feel shy or embarrassed to talk
                    about it.

                    Urinary incontinence can cause sudden urgency or leakage before
                    reaching the toilet. Although common among women, it is a treatable
                    medical condition, and early consultation can greatly improve
                    comfort and confidence.

                <h2>What is Urinary Incontinence?</h2>
                <p>
                    Urinary incontinence is when urine leaks out before you can get to a
                    toilet. It usually happens in three main ways:
                </p>

                <dl>
                    <dt><strong>Stress Incontinence</strong></dt>
                    <dd>
                        This is the most common type. It happens when physical movement
                        puts pressure on your bladder. If you leak a little when you
                        laugh, sneeze, cough, lift heavy objects, or bend over, this is
                        likely stress incontinence. It happens because the muscles that
                        close the bladder are weak.
                    </dd>

                    <dt><strong>Urge Incontinence</strong></dt>
                    <dd>
                        This is when you get a sudden, strong need to urinate that you
                        cannot control. It happens with little warning.
                    </dd>

                    <dt><strong>Mixed Incontinence</strong></dt>
                    <dd>
                        This is a diagnosis given when you have symptoms of both stress
                        and urge incontinence.
                    </dd>
                </dl>
            </section>

            <figure>
                <img class="rounded-xl" src="/images/treatments/urinary-incontinence/normal-vs-overactive-bladder.avif"
                    alt="Side-by-side medical illustration comparing a normal urinary bladder with an overactive urinary bladder, showing differences in bladder muscle activity and urine control." />
                <figcaption>
                    A normal bladder stores urine until you are ready to urinate, while
                    an overactive bladder contracts too early, causing sudden urgency
                    and possible leakage. Proper diagnosis helps identify effective
                    treatments to regain bladder control.

                <h2>Why Does It Happen?</h2>
                <p>
                    There are several reasons why women experience this. Understanding
                    your risk factors is a key part of your health checkup.
                </p>

                <h3>1. Pregnancy and Childbirth</h3>
                <p>
                    Pregnancy puts a lot of pressure on the bladder and pelvic floor
                    muscles due to the baby's weight and hormonal changes.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Common Symptoms:</strong> Many pregnant women need to
                        visit the toilet frequently or wake up at night to urinate.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Risk Factors:</strong> Your risk is higher if you are
                        older, or have had multiple children.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Delivery Method:</strong> Interestingly, studies show that
                        pregnancy itself strains the pelvic floor. Whether you had a
                        normal delivery or a C-section, the risk of incontinence remains
                        similar.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Lifestyle and Health</h3>
                <p>Your daily habits play a big role in your bladder health.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Smoking:</strong> Tobacco use is a major risk factor.
                        Quitting smoking can significantly help stop the leakage.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Body Weight:</strong> Being overweight puts extra pressure
                        on your bladder. Managing your weight is a great step toward
                        prevention.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Caffeine:</strong> While many people think tea or coffee
                        causes leaks, some studies show the link isn't as strong as we
                        thought. However, water is always the best choice for your health.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>How It Affects Daily Life</h2>
                <p>
                    Bladder leakage is not just a physical problem; it affects your
                    happiness, too.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Emotional Health:</strong> It can cause anxiety and make
                        you feel isolated or distressed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Social Life:</strong> Many women stop traveling, visiting
                        friends, or doing physical activities because they are afraid of
                        an accident.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Intimacy:</strong> It can affect your sexual health and
                        confidence.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>When to Seek Help</h2>
                <p>
                    Many women think a little leakage is "normal" or are too embarrassed
                    to seek help. However, incontinence is a medical condition that
                    requires treatment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Simple lifestyle changes, like quitting smoking and managing your
                    weight, can help. But for many, a professional diagnosis is
                    necessary to find the right solution.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Don't wait until it gets worse.</strong></p>
