                    Lower abdominal or pelvic pain is one of the most common symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease
                    (PID). Because symptoms can be mild or overlooked, early medical evaluation and treatment are
                    essential to prevent complications such as infertility or chronic pelvic pain.

                <h2>What is Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)?</h2>
                <p>
                    Pelvic Inflammatory Disease, or PID, is an infection of a woman's reproductive organs. It affects
                    the upper genital tract, which includes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The uterus (womb)</li>
                    <li>The fallopian tubes</li>
                    <li>The ovaries</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The infection usually happens when bacteria move up from the vagina or cervix into these internal
                    organs. The good news is that if you book a doctor consultation early, PID is
                    completely curable. However, if left untreated, it can lead to long-term health issues, including
                    difficulty getting pregnant.
                </p>

                <figcaption>
                    Pelvic inflammatory disease occurs when bacteria travel from the cervix into the uterus, fallopian
                    tubes, and ovaries, causing inflammation and swelling. Early diagnosis and antibiotic treatment are
                    crucial to stop the infection, relieve pain, and prevent long‑term complications such as infertility
                    or ectopic pregnancy.

                <h2>What Causes PID?</h2>
                <p>
                    PID is caused by bacteria. In many cases, it is linked to untreated sexually transmitted infections
                    (STIs) like chlamydia and gonorrhea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, it is important to know that <strong>not all cases are caused by STIs</strong>. You can
                    also develop PID if normal bacteria travel up into your reproductive organs. This can happen after:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Childbirth</li>
                    <li>A miscarriage or abortion</li>
                    <li>Pelvic surgery</li>
                    <li>Getting an IUD (Intrauterine Device) inserted</li>

                <figcaption>
                    Pelvic inflammatory disease affects the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries when infection spreads
                    upward from the vagina or cervix. Inflammation of these organs can cause pelvic pain and, if
                    untreated, may lead to infertility or other serious complications—making early diagnosis and
                    treatment essential.

                <h2>Common Symptoms: What to Look For</h2>
                <p>
                    PID can be tricky because symptoms are often mild. Some women feel no pain at all. However, if you
                    notice any of the following, it is time for a health checkup:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lower Abdominal Pain:</strong> Pain or tenderness in your lower belly or pelvis is the
                        most common sign.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unusual Discharge:</strong> Increased vaginal discharge that has a bad smell or looks
                        yellow/green.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pain During Sex:</strong> Discomfort deep inside during intercourse.</li>
                    <li><strong>Urinary Issues:</strong> A burning sensation or pain when you pass urine.</li>
                    <li><strong>Irregular Bleeding:</strong> Spotting between periods or bleeding after sex.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flu-like Symptoms:</strong> Fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    How do we confirm if you have PID? At Maria Hospital in Kathmandu, our
                    compassionate doctors use a combination of methods to give you an accurate
                    diagnosis:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Medical History:</strong> We will chat about your symptoms and health history in a
                        confidential setting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pelvic Exam:</strong> The doctor will gently check for tenderness in your pelvic area.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Lab Tests:</strong> We may test fluid samples or urine to identify the bacteria causing
                        the infection.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ultrasound:</strong> In some cases, we use ultrasound imaging to get a clear picture of
                        your reproductive organs.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Treatment Options in Nepal</h2>
                <p>
                    Once diagnosed, PID is generally treated with antibiotics. Since different bacteria can cause the
                    infection, your doctor at Maria Hospital may prescribe a combination of medicines
                    to ensure the infection is fully cleared.
                </p>
                <p>For successful treatment, remember to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Finish Your Medicine:</strong> Take every pill prescribed, even if you start feeling
                        better.</li>
                    <li><strong>Treat Your Partner:</strong> If the cause is an STI, your partner must also get a
                        <strong>health checkup</strong> and treatment to prevent reinfection.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid Sex:</strong> Wait until treatment is finished and symptoms are gone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Follow Up:</strong> Visit us again within 2-3 days to ensure the medicine is working.
                    </li>

                <h2>Why Early Treatment Matters</h2>
                <p>
                    Treating PID quickly is vital. Delaying a <strong>doctor consultation</strong> can lead to serious
                    complications, such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Infertility:</strong> Blocked fallopian tubes can make it difficult to get pregnant.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Ectopic Pregnancy:</strong> A dangerous condition where a fertilized egg grows outside
                        the uterus.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chronic Pain:</strong> Long-lasting pelvic pain that can persist for months.</li>
                </ul>
