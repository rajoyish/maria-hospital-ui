                    It can be hard to know what is "normal." Generally, most people
                    visit the bathroom about seven to eight times a day.

                <p>You may need a health checkup if:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>You use the bathroom more than 8 times in 24 hours.</li>
                    <li>
                        You wake up more than twice every night to urinate (a condition
                        called <em>nocturia</em>).

                        The constant need to go is disturbing your sleep, job, or daily

                <h2 id="causes">Common Causes of Frequent Urination</h2>

                <p>
                    Frequent urination is usually a symptom of another issue, not a
                    disease itself. Here are the most common reasons:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)</h3>
                        <p>
                            This is the most
                            <a href="/treatments/urinary-tract-infections-uti-nepal">common cause</a>. A bacterial
                            infection in your kidneys or bladder can cause a
                            strong urge to pee, even if your bladder is empty. You may also
                            feel a burning sensation.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Diabetes</h3>
                        <p>
                            Frequent urination is often an early warning sign of Type 1 and
                            Type 2 diabetes. When the body cannot process sugar properly,
                            the kidneys work hard to filter it out, creating more urine. A
                            simple blood test at Maria Hospital can confirm this.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Prostate Issues (In Men)</h3>
                        <p>
                            For men over 50, an enlarged prostate (BPH) is very common. The
                            prostate presses against the urethra, blocking flow and
                            irritating the bladder.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Pregnancy</h3>
                        <p>
                            Hormonal changes and the baby pressing on the bladder make this
                            very common for expecting mothers. This usually goes away after
                            childbirth.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Medication and Lifestyle</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Medicine:</strong> High blood pressure pills
                                (diuretics) remove fluid from the body, making you pee more.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Diet:</strong> Caffeine (found in coffee and tea) and
                                alcohol can irritate the bladder. In Nepal, drinking many cups
                                of strong tea is a common habit that may increase your urge to
                                go.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    The treatment depends entirely on the cause. For example, we use

                <ul>
