                <p>If the foreskin is too tight or there is too much extra skin, it can lead to several health issues:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Frequent Infections:</strong> Dirt and natural fluids can get trapped under the skin,
                        causing swelling and infections.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Trouble Peeing:</strong> In severe cases, the skin blocks the flow of urine, which can
                        hurt or cause urinary tract infections.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Sexual Issues:</strong> It can cause pain or over-sensitivity during sex.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Higher Risk of STIs:</strong> Irritated skin makes it easier to catch or spread sexually
                        transmitted infections.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Risk to Partners:</strong> Bacteria trapped under the foreskin can sometimes cause
                        infections in female partners.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Worry and Stress:</strong> Men may feel anxious or embarrassed about the smell or how it
                        looks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Serious Health Risks:</strong> Although it is rare, long-term irritation over many years
                        is linked to a higher risk of penile cancer.
                    </li>

                <h2 id="circumcision-help">How Circumcision Can Help</h2>
                <p>Circumcision is a surgery to remove the foreskin. It offers several benefits for those suffering from
                    phimosis:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Stops Infections:</strong> It prevents fluids from building up, which stops most
                        infections from happening.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Better Hygiene:</strong> It makes it much easier to keep the penis clean and reduces
                        odors.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Better Sex Life:</strong> It fixes the pain caused by tight skin, making sex more
                        comfortable.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <aside aria-label="Medical Recommendation">
                <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> If you have frequent infections, pain during sex, or trouble peeing,
                    you should see a doctor (a urologist) to check if you need treatment.</p>
