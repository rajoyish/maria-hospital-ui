                    Do you feel a burning, stinging, or uncomfortable sensation when you
                    pee? This condition is medically known as <strong>Dysuria</strong>.
                    It is a very common symptom that many people face, especially women.

                    While it can be worrying, pain during urination is usually a sign of
                    an underlying issue that can be treated. At Maria Hospital in
                    Kathmandu, we are here to help you understand your symptoms and

                    Pain or burning during urination is commonly caused by
                    infections—especially UTIs, STIs, and vaginal infections (and
                    prostatitis in men)—though non-infectious irritation can also
                    trigger symptoms.

                <h2>What Does Painful Urination Feel Like?</h2>
                <p>
                    Most patients describe the feeling as a sharp burn or itch. Pay
                    attention to when the pain happens, as this helps our doctors find
                    the cause:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Pain at the start:</strong> usually points to a problem in
                        the urethra (the tube where urine comes out), often caused by a
                        <a href="/treatments/urinary-tract-infections-uti-nepal">
                            Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)

                        .
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Pain after finishing:</strong> may signal an issue with
                        the bladder or prostate.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Watch out for these other symptoms:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A strong or frequent urge to urinate.</li>
                    <li>Cloudy or bloody urine.</li>
                    <li>Fever or back pain.</li>
                    <li>Unusual discharge.</li>

                <h2>Common Causes of Pain</h2>
                <p>
                    Why is this happening? Doctors generally divide the causes into two
                    types: infections and non-infectious irritations.
                </p>

                <h3>1. Infections (Most Common)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs):</strong> The most common
                        reason, especially for women. Bacteria enter the urinary tract and
                        cause inflammation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs):</strong> In active
                        adults, infections like chlamydia or gonorrhea can cause
                        significant pain.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Vaginal Infections:</strong> Bacterial imbalances or yeast
                        infections can make the skin sensitive and painful when urine
                        touches it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Prostatitis:</strong> Men may experience pain due to
                        infection or inflammation of the prostate gland.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Irritation and Other Causes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Chemical Products:</strong> Harsh soaps, scented toilet
                        paper, or bubble baths can irritate sensitive skin.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Physical Conditions:</strong> Kidney stones or an enlarged
                        prostate can make urination difficult and painful.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Diet &amp; Medicine:</strong> Spicy foods, caffeine, or
                        certain medications can sometimes irritate the bladder.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                    Discomfort during urination can have many causes, from urinary tract infections and sexually
                    transmitted infections to irritation from products, diet, or underlying physical conditions.

                <h2>How We Diagnose the Problem</h2>
                <p>
                    To stop the pain, we must first find the cause. When you visit Maria
                    Hospital for a doctor consultation, we may use the following
                    methods:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Medical History:</strong> We will ask about your symptoms
                        and health history.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Urine Tests:</strong> A simple sample helps us check for
                        bacteria and signs of infection.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Swab Tests:</strong> If an infection is suspected, a
                        gentle swab can identify the specific bacteria.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Ultrasound:</strong> If the problem persists, we may use
                        imaging to check for stones or other internal issues.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Effective Treatment Options</h2>
                <p>
                    The right treatment depends entirely on the cause.
                    <strong>Self-medication is not recommended.</strong> Common medical
                    solutions include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Antibiotics:</strong> Prescribed to clear up bacterial
                        infections like UTIs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Antifungals:</strong> Used if the cause is a yeast
                        infection.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Lifestyle Changes:</strong> Avoiding harsh soaps and
                        irritants.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Specialized Care:</strong> Treating underlying issues like
                        kidney stones or prostate enlargement.
