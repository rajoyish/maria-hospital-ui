                <h1>Blood in Urine (Hematuria) Treatment</h1>
            </header>

            <p>Seeing blood in your urine can be a very scary experience. It is natural to feel worried, but please
                remember:
                you are not alone. This is a common condition that doctors see frequently.</p>

            <p>While it can sometimes signal a serious issue, in many cases, the cause is minor and easily treatable. At
                <strong>Maria Hospital</strong>, located in Kathmandu, Nepal, we are dedicated to helping you understand
                your
                symptoms and providing the right care.
            </p>

            <section>
                <h2>What Is Hematuria?</h2>
                <p>"Hematuria" is the medical term for blood in the urine. It means that the kidneys or another part of
                    your
                    urinary tract (bladder, tubes, etc.) are allowing blood cells to leak into your urine.</p>

                <p>There are two main types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Visible (Gross) Hematuria:</strong> You can see this with your naked eye. Your urine may
                        look
                        pink, bright red, or brownish (like tea or cola).</li>
                    <li><strong>Invisible (Microscopic) Hematuria:</strong> The urine looks normal to you, but a small
                        amount of
                        blood is found when a doctor tests your urine under a microscope during a health checkup.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Signs and Symptoms to Watch For</h2>
                <p>The most obvious sign is a change in the color of your urine. However, depending on the cause, you
                    might also
                    feel:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pain or burning when you pass urine.</li>
                    <li>Frequent urination or a sudden, strong urge to go.</li>
                    <li>Back or side pain (often linked to kidney issues).</li>
                    <li>Fever or chills, which usually suggests an infection.</li>
                    <li>Blood clots in the urine, which can be painful.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Common Causes of Blood in Urine</h2>
                <p>Blood can come from anywhere in your urinary system. Common causes seen by doctors in Nepal include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs):</strong> Bacteria enter the bladder or kidneys, causing
                        infection, pain, and bleeding.</li>
                    <li><strong>Kidney or Bladder Stones:</strong> Minerals in the urine form hard stones. When these
                        stones
                        move or get stuck, they cause severe pain and bleeding.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enlarged Prostate:</strong> In older men, the prostate gland can grow and press on the
                        urinary
                        tube, causing bleeding.</li>
                    <li><strong>Trauma:</strong> An injury from an accident or sports contact.</li>
                    <li><strong>Medications:</strong> Some blood thinners or antibiotics can increase bleeding risks.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Cancer:</strong> Though less common, visible blood can be a sign of kidney or bladder
                        cancer.
                        <em>Note: This is often painless, so do not ignore blood just because it doesn't hurt.</em>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <aside>
                <h3>Did you know?</h3>
                <p>Not all red urine is blood. Foods like beets or blackberries, and certain medicines, can turn urine
                    pink.
                    However, it is always safer to get a doctor consultation to be sure.</p>

                <h2>Diagnosis: How We Find the Cause</h2>
                <p>At Maria Hospital, we use advanced technology to get an accurate diagnosis. Your checkup may include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Urinalysis:</strong> A simple test to check your urine for infection, red blood cells,
                        and
                        protein.</li>
                    <li><strong>Medical History:</strong> Your doctor will ask about your health history and risk
                        factors (like
                        smoking).</li>
                    <li><strong>Imaging (Ultrasound or CT Scan):</strong> These safe scans help us "see" inside your
                        body to
                        spot stones or tumors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cystoscopy:</strong> If needed, a doctor uses a tiny camera tube to look directly inside
                        your
                        bladder.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Treatment Options at Maria Hospital</h2>
                <p>Your treatment plan depends entirely on what is causing the bleeding:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>For Infections:</strong> We prescribe antibiotics to clear the bacteria.</li>
                    <li><strong>For Kidney Stones:</strong> Small stones may pass with water; larger ones might need
                        sound-wave
                        therapy or minor procedures to remove them.</li>
                    <li><strong>For Prostate Issues:</strong> Medication can help shrink the prostate.</li>
                    <li><strong>For Cancer:</strong> Our specialist team will create a comprehensive plan involving
                        surgery or
                        therapy.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>When Should You See a Doctor?</h2>
                <p><strong>Do not wait.</strong> If you see blood in your urine, book a doctor consultation immediately.
                    Even if
                    it happens only once, or if you have no pain, it needs to be checked.</p>

                <p>Seek help immediately if:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You cannot urinate at all.</li>
                    <li>You see blood clots.</li>
                    <li>You have severe pain or a high fever.</li>
                    <li>You have had a physical injury to your back or stomach.</li>
                </ul>
