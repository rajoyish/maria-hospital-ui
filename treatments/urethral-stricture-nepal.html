                    Do you feel like your urine flow is weak or slower than usual? You
                    might be experiencing a condition called
                    <strong>Urethral Stricture</strong>.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    Think of the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body)
                    like a garden hose. If there is a kink or narrowing in the hose, the
                    water cannot flow freely. A urethral stricture is essentially scar
                    tissue that narrows this tube, restricting the flow of urine. While
                    this can happen to anyone, it is most common in men.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    The good news is that expert help is available. At
                    <strong>Maria Hospital</strong>, we provide comprehensive care to
                    help you get back to normal life.

                <figcaption>
                    Urethral stricture occurs when scar tissue narrows the urethra,
                    restricting urine flow from the bladder. This narrowing can cause a
                    weak stream, straining, and incomplete emptying, but accurate
                    diagnosis and modern treatments can restore normal urine flow.

                <h2>Common Signs and Symptoms</h2>
                <p>
                    Symptoms can appear suddenly or develop slowly over time. If you
                    notice any of the following, it might be time for a doctor
                    consultation:
                </p>

                <dl>
                    <dt>Weak Urine Flow</dt>
                    <dd>The stream is slow, or you have to strain to empty your bladder.</dd>

                    <dt>Incomplete Emptying</dt>
                    <dd>Feeling like there is still urine left even after you finish.</dd>

                    <dt>Spraying</dt>
                    <dd>The urine stream sprays or splits into two.</dd>

                    <dt>Pain</dt>
                    <dd>Discomfort in the lower abdomen or pain while urinating.</dd>

                    <dt>Frequent Infections</dt>
                    <dd>Recurring Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs).</dd>

                    <dt>Blood</dt>
                    <dd>Noticing blood in your urine or semen.</dd>
                </dl>

                <p>
                    <strong>Important:</strong> If you suddenly cannot pass urine at
                    all, this is a medical emergency. Seek immediate help to prevent
                    kidney damage.

                <h2>What Causes the Scar Tissue?</h2>
                <p>
                    Strictures are usually caused by inflammation or injury. Common
                    causes include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Injury:</strong> Falling on the pelvic area or "straddle
                        injuries."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Infection:</strong> Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
                        like gonorrhea or chlamydia.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Medical Procedures:</strong> Previous surgeries or the use
                        of urinary catheters.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Unknown Causes:</strong> Sometimes, strictures form
                        without a clear reason.

                <h2>Diagnosis: How We Find the Problem</h2>
                <p>
                    If you are worried about your symptoms, a health checkup is the
                    first step. Your doctor may recommend a few simple tests for an
                    accurate diagnosis:
                </p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Urine Flow Test</dt>
                    <dd>A simple machine measures the speed of your urine stream.</dd>

                    <dt>Ultrasound</dt>
                    <dd>
                        We check how much urine remains in the bladder after you use the
                        restroom.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>X-Ray (Retrograde Urethrogram)</dt>
                    <dd>
                        A special dye helps us see the exact location and size of the
                        narrowing. [Image of Retrograde Urethrogram x-ray showing urethral
                        stricture]
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Cystoscopy</dt>
                    <dd>
                        A thin camera allows the doctor to look directly inside the
                        urethra.
                    </dd>
                </dl>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Effective Treatment Options</h2>
                <p>
                    Medication alone usually cannot fix a stricture; the narrowing often
                    needs to be physically opened. Fortunately, effective treatment is
                    available right here in Kathmandu in Nepal.
                </p>

                <section>
                    <h3>1. Dilation (Widening)</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is a simple procedure where the doctor gently stretches the
                        narrowed area using progressively larger tubes or a balloon. It is
                        often done under local anesthesia.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>2. Urethrotomy (Cutting)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Using a specialized scope, the doctor makes a small cut in the
                        scar tissue to widen the gap. A catheter is temporarily placed to
                        help the area heal.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>3. Urethral Reconstruction (Urethroplasty)</h3>
                    <p>
                        For severe or recurring strictures, reconstruction surgery is
                        often the best long-term solution. Surgeons remove the scar tissue
                        and reconnect the healthy parts of the urethra. In some cases, a
                        small graft from the cheek lining is used to rebuild the tube.

                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>4. Drug-Coated Balloon</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is a newer method where a balloon stretches the urethra while
                        delivering medication directly to the tissue to prevent the scar
                        from growing back.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Practice Safe Sex:</strong> Use protection to avoid STIs
                        that cause inflammation.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Protect Yourself:</strong> Be careful during sports or
                        activities to avoid pelvic injury.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Gentle Care:</strong> If you use catheters, handle them
                        gently with plenty of lubrication.
