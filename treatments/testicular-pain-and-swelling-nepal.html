                    Testicular pain or swelling can be very worrying for any man. Because this area is sensitive, even a
                    small injury can hurt a lot. We understand that many men feel shy or embarrassed to talk about these
                    problems, but ignoring pain in the scrotum is dangerous.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    At Maria Hospital, we want you to know that most causes are treatable. However, some conditions need
                    immediate medical attention to prevent permanent damage. Your health is our priority.

                    Testicular pain or swelling should never be ignored. While many causes are treatable, some
                    conditions—such as testicular torsion or infection—require urgent medical attention. Early
                    consultation helps protect testicular health and prevent complications.

                <p>
                    Do not wait if you have severe symptoms. You should seek immediate doctor consultation or go to the
                    Emergency Room if you experience:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sudden, severe pain in one or both testicles.</li>
                    <li>Pain accompanied by nausea or vomiting.</li>
                    <li>Swelling, redness, or if the testicle feels like it is sitting higher than usual.</li>
                    <li>Pain caused by a serious injury or accident.</li>

                    Testicular pain or swelling can be a sign of infection, injury, or more serious conditions like

                    damage.

                <h2>Common Causes of Pain and Swelling</h2>
                <p>
                    There are several reasons why you might feel pain or see swelling. Here is a simple breakdown:
                </p>

                <article>
                    <h3>1. Testicular Torsion (Requires Immediate Action)</h3>
                    <p>
                        This happens when the cord that brings blood to the testicle twists. It cuts off the blood
                        supply.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Sudden severe pain, swelling on one side, and nausea.</li>
                        <li><strong>Action:</strong> This is an emergency. Surgery is usually needed within 6 hours to
                            save the testicle.</li>
                    </ul>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>2. Infection and Inflammation</h3>
                    <p>Infections are a common reason for doctor consultation at our hospital.</p>
                    <dl>
                        <dt><strong>Epididymitis</strong></dt>
                        <dd>
                            Inflammation of the tube at the back of the testicle. It is often caused by bacteria or
                            <a href="/treatments/urinary-tract-infections-uti-nepal">urinary tract infections</a>.
                            You may feel a warm, swollen scrotum.
                        </dd>

                        <dt><strong>Orchitis</strong></dt>
                        <dd>
                            Swelling of the testicle itself, often caused by a virus (like mumps) or bacteria. It can
                            cause fever.
                        </dd>
                    </dl>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>3. Lumps, Cysts, and Hernias</h3>
                    <dl>
                        <dt><strong>Varicocele</strong></dt>
                        <dd>
                            Swollen veins inside the scrotum. It often feels like a "bag of worms" and causes a dull
                            ache.
                        </dd>

                        <dt><strong>Hydrocele</strong></dt>
                        <dd>
                            Fluid buildup around the testicle. It causes painless swelling and is common in both babies
                            and adults.
                        </dd>

                        <dt><strong>Inguinal Hernia</strong></dt>
                        <dd>
                            When tissue pushes through a weak spot in your muscles into the groin. You might see a bulge
                            when you stand up.
                        </dd>
                    </dl>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>4. Injuries and Trauma</h3>
                    <p>
                        A direct hit to the groin during sports or an accident can cause pain and bruising. While rest
                        helps, severe injuries need a proper <strong>diagnosis</strong> to ensure there is no internal
                        bleeding.

                </ul>

            <section>
                <h2>Treatment Options</h2>
                <p>Your treatment depends on what is causing the pain:</p>

                    <li><strong>Surgery:</strong> Necessary for emergencies like torsion or severe hernias.</li>
                    <li>
