                <p class="lead">Ear pain is a common health issue that can ruin your sleep and disrupt your daily
                    routine. However,
                    not all
                    ear pain is the same. Knowing the difference between an outer ear infection (<strong>Otitis
                        Externa</strong>) and a middle ear infection (<strong>Otitis Media</strong>) is important
                    because they
                    require very different treatments.</p>
                <p class="lead">Whether you are suffering from a sudden earache or your child is crying from ear pain,
                    getting the
                    right
                    <strong>diagnosis</strong> is key. This guide helps you understand the symptoms, causes, and best

                    Ear pain is a common symptom of otitis externa (outer ear infection) and otitis media (middle ear
                    infection).
                    Recognizing persistent earache, pressure, or discomfort early and seeking proper diagnosis at Maria
                    Hospital, Kathmandu
                    helps ensure safe and effective treatment.

                <h2>1. Otitis Externa (Outer Ear Infection)</h2>
                <h3>What is it?</h3>
                <p>Often called "Swimmer’s Ear," this is an infection of the ear canal—the tube connecting your outer
                    ear to the
                    eardrum. In Nepal, this often happens during humid weather or after swimming. The skin inside the
                    ear is
                    thin and sensitive, making it easy for bacteria to grow if it stays wet.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img class="h-auto w-full rounded-xl" src="/images/treatments/otitis-media-and-externa/externa.avif"

                        the ear canal and cause
                        pain and discharge—helping patients understand why proper ear drops and doctor consultation at
                        Maria Hospital are
                        essential for effective treatment.
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h3>Common Causes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Moisture:</strong> Water trapped in the ear from swimming or high humidity weakens the
                        skin.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Trauma:</strong> Cleaning ears with cotton swabs (Q-tips), fingernails, or hairpins is a
                        major
                        cause. This causes tiny scratches where bacteria enter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chemicals:</strong> Shampoo, hair spray, or hair dye can irritate the ear canal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fungus:</strong> Sometimes, the infection is fungal, especially if you have used
                        antibiotic
                        drops for too long without a doctor's advice.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Symptoms to Watch For</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pain on Touch:</strong> The clearest sign is severe pain when you pull your earlobe or
                        push the
                        small bump (tragus) in front of your ear.</li>
                    <li><strong>Itching:</strong> Often the first sign before the pain starts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Swelling:</strong> The ear might feel "blocked" or muffled.</li>
                    <li><strong>Discharge:</strong> You might see fluid draining out, which can be clear or pus-like.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                <p>Treatment is usually applied directly to the ear.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ear Drops:</strong> A <strong>doctor consultation</strong> is necessary to get the right
                        antibiotic or antifungal drops.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ear Wicks:</strong> If the swelling is severe, a doctor at <strong>Maria
                            Hospital</strong> may
                        insert a tiny sponge (wick) to help the medicine reach inside.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pain Relief:</strong> Simple painkillers help manage the discomfort.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>2. Otitis Media (Middle Ear Infection)</h2>

                <h3>What is it?</h3>
                <p>This is an infection behind the eardrum. It is very common in young children in
                    <strong>Nepal</strong>
                    because their drainage tubes (Eustachian tubes) are smaller and easily blocked.
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <img class="h-auto w-full rounded-xl" src="/images/treatments/otitis-media-and-externa/media.avif"

                        inflammation behind the eardrum
                        due to a blocked Eustachian tube—explaining symptoms like deep ear pain, fever, and hearing
                        difficulty and the need for
                        proper medical evaluation at Maria Hospital, Kathmandu.
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h3>Common Causes</h3>
                <p>Unlike outer ear infections, this usually starts <em>inside</em> the body.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Colds and Flu:</strong> It often follows a respiratory infection, cold, or allergy.
                        Congestion
                        blocks the ear from draining.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fluid Buildup:</strong> Fluid gets trapped behind the eardrum and becomes infected by
                        bacteria
                        or viruses.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Symptoms to Watch For</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Deep Pain:</strong> A deep, throbbing pressure inside the head. Unlike outer ear
                        infections,
                        pulling the earlobe usually <em>does not</em> make it hurt more.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fever:</strong> High fever is common, especially in children.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hearing Loss:</strong> Sounds may seem dull, like you are underwater.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rupture:</strong> In severe cases, the eardrum may tear to release the pressure, causing
                        fluid
                        to drain out.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Wait and See:</strong> Since many middle ear infections are viral, they may heal on
                        their own.
                        However, a <strong>health checkup</strong> is vital to monitor the progress.</li>
                    <li><strong>Oral Antibiotics:</strong> If it is a bacterial infection, a doctor will prescribe oral
                        medicine
                        (like Amoxicillin).</li>
                    <li><strong>Medical Procedures:</strong> For frequent infections, a specialist might suggest a minor
                        procedure to help the ear drain.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Prevention Tips for Healthy Ears</h2>

                <h3>To Prevent Outer Ear Infections:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Keep it Dry:</strong> Dry your ears gently after showering or swimming.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stop Using Q-Tips:</strong> Do not put cotton swabs, pins, or fingers inside your ear
                        canal.
                        This pushes wax deeper and damages the skin.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>To Prevent Middle Ear Infections:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hygiene:</strong> Wash hands often to avoid catching colds and flu.</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid Smoke:</strong> Keep children away from cigarette smoke or heavy pollution, as
                        this
                        irritates the inner tubes of the ear.</li>
