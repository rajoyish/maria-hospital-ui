        <p class="lead">Do you hear a buzzing, humming, or ringing sound in your ears, even when the room is
          completely
          quiet? You
          are not alone. This condition is called <strong>Tinnitus</strong> (pronounced <em>tin-NITE-us</em>),
          and it
          is a very common issue for many people in Nepal.</p>
        <p class="lead">At <strong>Maria Hospital in Kathmandu</strong>, we understand how frustrating these
          sounds can be.
          The good
          news is that tinnitus is usually not a disease itself. Instead, it is a symptom of other conditions,
          like
          hearing loss or simple ear blockages. You do not have to suffer in silence—help is available.</p>

        <figcaption>
          Tinnitus causes persistent ringing, buzzing, or humming sounds in the ears, even in quiet
          environments. Although often
          linked to hearing changes or ear blockages, proper medical evaluation can identify the cause and
          help manage symptoms
          effectively.

      <section>
        <h2>What Does Tinnitus Sound Like?</h2>
        <p>While people often call it "ringing in the ears," tinnitus can sound different for everyone. You
          might hear:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Buzzing</strong> or humming (like an electric wire).</li>
          <li><strong>Hissing</strong>, clicking, or whistling.</li>
          <li><strong>Roaring</strong> (like the sound of the ocean).</li>
          <li><strong>Pulsing</strong> (a thumping sound that beats in time with your heart).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These sounds might happen in one ear, both ears, or feel like they are inside your head. They might
          come and
          go, or stay with you all day.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Why Is This Happening? (Common Causes)</h2>
        <p>Doctors believe tinnitus is often the brain’s reaction to changes in the ear. To understand this, it
          helps to
          look at how the ear is structured.</p>

        <figure>
          <img class="h-auto w-full rounded-xl" src="/images/treatments/tinnitus/brain-signal.avif" width="1200"
            height="630" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async"
            alt="Medical illustration showing the inner ear and auditory nerve sending signals to the brain, with highlighted brain activity indicating abnormal sound perception associated with tinnitus." />
          <figcaption>
            Tinnitus occurs when changes in the ear or auditory nerve cause the brain to misinterpret sound
            signals, leading to
            ringing or buzzing without an external source. Understanding this ear–brain connection helps
            guide effective diagnosis
            and symptom management.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Common triggers include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Loud Noise:</strong> Exposure to loud traffic in Kathmandu, construction noise, or loud
            music
            can damage delicate parts of the inner ear.</li>
          <li><strong>Ear Blockages:</strong> A simple buildup of earwax or dirt can block your ear canal.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Aging:</strong> As we get older (usually over 60), our hearing naturally changes.</li>
          <li><strong>Medications:</strong> Certain antibiotics or painkillers can trigger these sounds.</li>
          <li><strong>Health Conditions:</strong> High blood pressure, diabetes, or jaw problems can also be
            linked to
            tinnitus.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>When Should I See a Doctor?</h2>
        <p>For some, tinnitus is just a small annoyance. However, you should book a <strong>doctor
            consultation</strong>
          at Maria Hospital if:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The noise has lasted for <strong>more than one week</strong>.</li>
          <li>The sound affects your sleep, focus, or makes you feel anxious.</li>
          <li>The noise is significantly bothering you in your daily life.</li>
        </ul>

        <aside class="border-l-4 border-warning bg-warning/10 px-8 py-3">
          <p>⚠️ <strong>Seek immediate medical attention if:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>You have sudden <strong>hearing loss</strong> along with the ringing.</li>
            <li>You feel <strong>dizziness</strong> or vertigo (the room feels like it is spinning).</li>
            <li>You hear a pulsing sound that matches your heartbeat.</li>
          </ul>
        </aside>

      <section>
        <h2>How We Diagnose and Treat Tinnitus</h2>
        <p>When you visit Maria Hospital for a <strong>health checkup</strong>, our team will review your
          history and
          examine your ears, head, and neck. We may perform:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hearing Exams:</strong> To check how well you hear different sounds.</li>
          <li><strong>Movement Tests:</strong> Checking if moving your jaw or eyes changes the sound.</li>
          <li><strong>Lab Tests:</strong> Simple blood tests or scans to rule out other issues.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Effective Management Strategies</h2>
        <p>While there is no single "magic pill" for tinnitus, treating the root cause often stops the noise.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Earwax Removal:</strong> If wax is the cause, our doctors can safely remove it.</li>
          <li><strong>Medication Adjustment:</strong> If a medicine is causing the ringing, we can help you
            find an
            alternative.</li>
          <li><strong>Sound Therapy:</strong> Using "white noise" (like the sound of a fan or rain) can cover
            up the
            ringing so you can sleep better.</li>
          <li><strong>Lifestyle Changes:</strong> Reducing stress, avoiding loud noises, and lowering caffeine
            intake
            can help reduce symptoms.</li>
        </ul>
