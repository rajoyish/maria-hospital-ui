                    Your voice is how you connect with the world. But if your voice constantly feels hoarse, scratchy,
                    or tired, it might be a sign of a vocal cord issue, such as a nodule or a polyp.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    If you are experiencing these symptoms, there is no need to worry. This article from <strong>Maria
                        Hospital</strong> in Kathmandu, Nepal, will help you understand what is happening in your throat
                    and how the right diagnosis and treatment can bring your voice back to normal.

                        Vocal cord nodules (paired, callus-like growths) and polyps (single, blister-like growths) can
                        cause persistent hoarseness and voice fatigue. If your voice remains raspy for more than two
                        weeks, Maria Hospital in Kathmandu offers expert ENT evaluation and effective treatment,
                        including voice therapy or minor surgery when needed.

                <h2>What Are Vocal Cords?</h2>
                <p>
                    Your vocal cords are two flexible muscle bands inside your voice box. When you breathe, they stay
                    open. When you speak or sing, air from your lungs gently pushes them together. They vibrate against
                    each other to create the sound of your voice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, if you strain your voice too much, small, non-cancerous growths can form on these cords.
                    The two most common types are vocal cord nodules and vocal cord polyps.

            <section>
                <h2>Nodules vs. Polyps: What is the Difference?</h2>
                <p>Both conditions cause similar voice problems, but they look and develop differently:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Vocal Cord Nodules:</strong> Think of nodules like the hard calluses you get on your
                        hands from heavy work. They usually grow in pairs (one on each cord). Often called "singer's
                        nodes" or "teacher's nodules," they are common in women, children, and professionals who talk a
                        lot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vocal Cord Polyps:</strong> Polyps are softer, looking more like a small, fluid-filled
                        blister. They are usually larger, reddish in color, and often appear on just one vocal cord.
                        Polyps are more common in men.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>What Causes Voice Strain?</h2>
                <p>The main cause of both nodules and polyps is overusing, misusing, or straining your voice. Common
                    causes include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Talking loudly, shouting, or screaming.</li>
                    <li>Singing improperly or for long periods without resting.</li>
                    <li>Frequent coughing or clearing your throat.</li>
                    <li>Speaking too much when your throat is already sore from a cold.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Other everyday factors can also irritate your vocal cords, including smoking, heavy caffeine or
                    alcohol use, allergies, and acid reflux.

                <h2>Signs You Need a Health Checkup</h2>
                <p>How do you know it is time to seek help? Look out for these common symptoms that disrupt your daily
                    life:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A hoarse, raspy, or breathy voice that will not go away.</li>
                    <li>Your voice feels exhausted after just a short conversation.</li>
                    <li>Trouble hitting high notes when singing.</li>
                    <li>Your voice breaks or cracks unpredictably.</li>
                    <li>A feeling like there is a "lump" stuck in your throat.</li>
                    <li>Pain in your neck or ear when speaking.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Getting the Right Diagnosis</h2>
                <p>If your hoarseness lasts for more than two weeks, it is time to book a doctor consultation.</p>
                <p>
                    At <strong>Maria Hospital</strong>, our Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) specialists use gentle, advanced
                    methods to find the exact cause of your discomfort. Using a tiny, comfortable camera or special
                    slow-motion lights, we can look closely at your vocal cords to provide a highly accurate diagnosis
                    without any pain.

                <h2>Highly Effective Treatment Options</h2>
                <p>The best news is that these conditions are not cancer, and they are very treatable. Your personalized
                    treatment plan may include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Voice Rest and Care:</strong> Giving your voice a break and drinking plenty of water. If
                        allergies or acid reflux are causing the irritation, your doctor will provide medication to
                        manage them.</li>
                    <li><strong>Voice Therapy:</strong> Working with a specialist to learn safer ways to speak and
                        breathe. This simple therapy often shrinks nodules completely!</li>
                    <li><strong>Minor Surgery:</strong> If a polyp or a large nodule does not go away with rest, our
                        expert surgeons can carefully remove it. This is a quick procedure with no cuts on your neck,
                        allowing you to go home the same day.</li>

                <h2>Tips to Protect Your Voice</h2>
                <p>Keep your voice healthy and strong with these simple daily habits:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Drink plenty of water:</strong> Keep your throat moist throughout the day.</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid vocal extremes:</strong> Try not to yell, scream, or talk for hours without a
                        break.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use a microphone:</strong> If you are teaching or speaking to a crowd, use a mic to
                        avoid straining.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do not smoke:</strong> Cigarette smoke is highly damaging to the vocal cords.</li>
                    <li><strong>Warm up:</strong> Always prep your voice before heavy singing or public speaking.</li>
                </ul>
