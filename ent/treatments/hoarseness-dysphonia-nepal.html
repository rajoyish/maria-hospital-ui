                    Having a raspy, strained, or weak voice can be uncomfortable and frustrating. Medically known as
                    <em>dysphonia</em>, hoarseness is a common condition that changes how your voice sounds and often
                    leaves your throat feeling scratchy.

                <p class="lead">
                    While a hoarse voice usually gets better on its own, understanding what causes it is important for
                    your overall health. Whether you need a routine health checkup or specialized care, the medical team
                    at Maria Hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal, is here to provide accurate diagnosis and expert treatment.

                        Hoarseness (dysphonia) occurs when the vocal cords become swollen or irritated, affecting how
                        they vibrate to produce sound. If your voice remains raspy or weak for more than three weeks,
                        visit Maria Hospital in Kathmandu for expert ENT evaluation and treatment.

                <h2>How Does Your Voice Work?</h2>
                <p>
                    Your voice box (larynx) is located in your throat and contains two bands of muscle called vocal
                    cords. When you breathe, they open. When you speak or sing, they close, and air from your lungs
                    causes them to vibrate to create sound.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any swelling, irritation, or changes to these vocal cords will prevent them from vibrating smoothly,
                    resulting in a hoarse voice.

                <h2>Common Causes of Hoarseness</h2>
                <p>Many everyday factors can irritate your throat. Some of the most common causes include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Viral Infections (Acute Laryngitis):</strong> The most common cause. A cold or the flu
                        can easily make your vocal cords swell.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Voice Overuse:</strong> Shouting, cheering, or talking for long periods without a break
                        can strain your vocal cords.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Acid Reflux (GERD):</strong> Stomach acid moving up the throat can cause irritation,
                        often leaving you hoarse in the morning.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Smoking:</strong> Tobacco smoke dries out the throat and increases the risk of serious
                        voice changes, including throat cancer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Vocal Cord Growths:</strong> Long-term strain can lead to non-cancerous growths like
                        nodules, polyps, or cysts.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Aging:</strong> As we age, vocal cords naturally thin out and lose muscle tone.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>When Should You Book a Doctor Consultation?</h2>
                <p>
                    Most cases of hoarseness will clear up with simple voice rest. However, if your hoarseness lasts for
                    more than three weeks—especially if you do not have a cold—it is time to seek professional medical
                    advice.
                </p>
                <p>Visit Maria Hospital immediately if you experience any of these warning signs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Difficulty breathing or swallowing</li>
                    <li>Pain when speaking or swallowing</li>
                    <li>Coughing up blood</li>
                    <li>A noticeable lump in your neck</li>
                    <li>Complete loss of your voice for more than a few days</li>

                <h2>Diagnosis and Treatment at Maria Hospital</h2>
                <p>
                    When you come in for a health checkup at Maria Hospital, our Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) specialists
                    will focus on finding the exact cause of your discomfort.
                </p>

                <h3>Accurate Diagnosis</h3>
                <p>
                    To get a clear look at your vocal cords, your doctor may perform a quick, painless clinic procedure
                    called a laryngoscopy. Using a tiny, flexible camera, they will check your throat for inflammation
                    or movement issues.
                </p>

                <h3>Effective Treatment Options</h3>
                <p>Your treatment will be tailored to your specific diagnosis. Common solutions include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Voice Rest and Hydration:</strong> Resting your voice (avoid whispering, which actually
                        strains your cords more!) and drinking plenty of water.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Medications:</strong> Antacids for acid reflux, or specific medicines to reduce severe
                        swelling and clear infections.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Voice Therapy:</strong> Learning helpful vocal exercises from a specialist to prevent
                        future damage.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Surgery:</strong> In cases involving cysts, stubborn polyps, or more serious conditions,
                        minor surgical procedures can safely restore vocal function.
                    </li>

                <h2>Daily Tips to Protect Your Voice</h2>
                <p>You can take simple, everyday steps to keep your voice clear and healthy:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Drink plenty of water:</strong> Keep your throat moist by aiming for about 8 glasses a
                        day.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Avoid irritants:</strong> Quit smoking, avoid secondhand smoke, and limit alcohol and
                        caffeine.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Don't strain:</strong> Use a microphone if your job requires loud speaking, and avoid
                        shouting.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Stop clearing your throat:</strong> Hard throat-clearing aggressively rubs your vocal
                        cords together. Take a sip of water instead.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Use a humidifier:</strong> Adding moisture to the air in your home can soothe your
                        throat.</li>
                </ul>
