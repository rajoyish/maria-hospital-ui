                    Using cotton swabs (Q‑tips) inside the ear is one of the most common causes of ear wax blockage.
                    Instead of cleaning the
                    ear, they push wax deeper and can injure the eardrum. Safe ear wax removal should always be done
                    gently or by a medical
                    professional.

                <h2>What is Ear Wax and Why Do We Have It?</h2>
                <p>Ear wax (medically called <em>cerumen</em>) is actually a sign of a healthy ear. Your body produces
                    it to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Trap dust and dirt.</li>
                    <li>Keep water out of the ear canal.</li>
                    <li>Protect your sensitive eardrum from infection.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Usually, your ears are "self-cleaning." When you chew or talk, the movement of your jaw slowly pushes
                    old wax
                    out of the ear opening, where it dries and falls out. However, sometimes this process gets stuck,
                    leading to
                    a blockage.</p>
            </section>

            <figure>
                <img class="h-auto w-full rounded-xl" src="/images/treatments/ear-wax/blocked.avif" width="1200"
                    height="630" decoding="async"
                    alt="Medical diagram showing ear wax (cerumen) impaction blocking the ear canal" />
                <figcaption>
                    Ear wax blockage (cerumen impaction) occurs when wax builds up and hardens inside the ear canal,
                    preventing sound from
                    reaching the eardrum. This can cause muffled hearing, ear fullness, and discomfort, and is best
                    treated with safe
                    medical removal rather than home instruments.

                <h2>Signs You Might Have an Ear Wax Blockage</h2>
                <p>How do you know if you need a <strong>doctor consultation</strong>? Look out for these common
                    symptoms:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hearing Loss:</strong> Sounds seem quiet or muffled.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fullness:</strong> A feeling that your ear is plugged up (like being underwater).</li>
                    <li><strong>Earache:</strong> Pain or discomfort inside the ear.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tinnitus:</strong> Ringing, buzzing, or humming noises.</li>
                    <li><strong>Itching:</strong> Constant itchiness deep inside the ear.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dizziness:</strong> Feeling off-balance.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Why Does Wax Build Up?</h2>
                <p>Blockages can happen to anyone, but here are the most common reasons:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Cotton Swabs (Q-Tips):</strong> This is the #1 cause. Using cotton buds often pushes wax
                        deeper
                        into the ear instead of removing it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Earphones and Hearing Aids:</strong> Frequent use stops wax from falling out naturally.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Anatomy:</strong> Some people just have narrower ear canals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Age:</strong> As we get older, ear wax becomes harder and drier.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>How to Treat Ear Wax Blockage Safely</h2>

                <h3>1. Safe Home Remedies</h3>
                <p>If your ear hurts or you have a history of ear holes (perforations), <strong>do not</strong> try this
                    at
                    home. Visit <strong>Maria Hospital</strong> instead.</p>
                <p>If your ear is healthy otherwise, you can try to soften the wax:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Use Drops:</strong> Put a few drops of baby oil, mineral oil, or glycerin in your ear.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Wait:</strong> Let it sit for 15 to 30 minutes to soften the hard wax.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gentle Rinse:</strong> You can gently rinse the ear with warm water (body temperature)
                        using a
                        bulb syringe. Tilt your head to let the water run out.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Professional Medical Treatment</h3>
                <p>If home remedies don't work, it is time for a professional <strong>health checkup</strong>. At
                    <strong>Maria
                        Hospital</strong>, our doctors use safe, specialized tools for <strong>diagnosis</strong> and
                    removal:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Irrigation:</strong> Flushing the ear safely with water.</li>
                    <li><strong>Manual Removal:</strong> Using small medical tools to carefully pull the wax out.</li>
                    <li><strong>Microsuction:</strong> A gentle vacuum technique often used by ENT specialists to suck
                        the wax
                        out without water.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>⚠️ Important: What NOT To Do</h2>
                <p>To protect your hearing, please follow these safety rules:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>NO Cotton Swabs:</strong> Never put cotton buds, pins, or matchsticks inside your ear.
                        You risk
                        puncturing your eardrum.</li>
                    <li><strong>NO Ear Candles:</strong> These are dangerous and can cause burns or serious damage.</li>
                    <li><strong>NO High Pressure:</strong> Do not use water jets (like dental flossers) in your ear.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>When Should You See a Doctor?</h2>
                <p>Skip the home remedies and seek a <strong>diagnosis</strong> immediately if:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You have severe ear pain or bleeding.</li>
                    <li>There is fluid or a bad smell coming from your ear.</li>
