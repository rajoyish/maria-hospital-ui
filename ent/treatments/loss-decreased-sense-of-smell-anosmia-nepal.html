                    Have you noticed that your morning coffee doesn’t smell as strong as
                    it used to? Or perhaps food has started to taste bland? You might be
                    experiencing <strong>Anosmia</strong>, which is the medical term for
                    the loss of smell.
                </p>

                <p class="lead">
                    At <strong>Maria Hospital</strong> in
                    <strong>Kathmandu, Nepal</strong>, we understand that losing this
                    sense can be worrying. It affects how you taste food and can even
                    stop you from sensing danger, like smoke or gas leaks. This article
                    explains why this happens and how our specialists can help you get
                    back to normal.

                    Loss or reduced sense of smell (anosmia) can make food taste bland
                    and may occur after infections, allergies, COVID-19, or nasal
                    polyps. If your sense of smell does not return, Maria Hospital in
                    Kathmandu offers expert evaluation and treatment to help restore it
                    safely.

                <h2>What is Anosmia?</h2>
                <p>
                    Anosmia is when you completely lose your sense of smell. If you can
                    still smell a little bit, but not as well as before, it is called
                    hyposmia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because smell and taste work together, many people think they have
                    lost their sense of taste. In reality, your tongue can still taste
                    sweet or salty things, but without smell, you miss out on the rich
                    flavors.
                </p>

                    <figcaption>
                        Loss of smell (anosmia) can occur when inflammation or blockage in
                        the nasal passages prevents scent signals from reaching the
                        olfactory bulb in the brain. Proper diagnosis at Maria Hospital in
                        Kathmandu helps identify the cause and guide effective treatment
                        for recovery.

                <h2>Why Did I Lose My Smell?</h2>
                <p>
                    Loss of smell can be temporary or permanent. Here are the most
                    common reasons:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            <a href="/treatments/sneezing-runny-nose-nasal-congestion-nepal">Nasal Congestion &amp;
                                Infections</a>:
                        </strong>
                        This is the most common cause. The common cold, flu, or sinus
                        infections (sinusitis) can block the nose. Allergies, which are
                        common in dusty seasons in Nepal, can also cause swelling that
                        hides scents.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            <a href="/treatments/nasal-polyps-nepal">Nasal Polyps</a>:
                        </strong>
                        These are soft, non-cancerous growths inside the nose that block
                        airflow.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>COVID-19:</strong> Many people lose their smell during
                        COVID-19, even without a stuffy nose. Fortunately, for most
                        people, the sense of smell returns as they recover.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Head Injuries:</strong> Accidents or falls can damage the
                        nerves that send smell signals to the brain.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Aging:</strong> It is natural for our senses to fade
                        slightly after age 60.
                    </li>

                    <li>Familiar smells (like spices or perfume) disappear.</li>
                    <li>Food tastes "flat" or strange.</li>

                        (like smoke).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Parosmia:</strong> Pleasant smells suddenly seem bad or
                        foul to you.

                <p>
                    If your sense of smell hasn't returned after a cold, it is time for
                    a doctor consultation. At Maria Hospital, our ENT (Ear, Nose, and
                    Throat) specialists can find the root cause.

                <p>The right treatment depends on what is causing the problem.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Medications:</strong> Steroid sprays or antibiotics can
                        help clear up infections and allergies.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Smell Training:</strong> This is a natural therapy where
                        you practice smelling strong scents (like lemon, rose, or clove)
                        twice a day to "retrain" your brain.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Surgery:</strong> If polyps are blocking your nose, a
                        minor procedure might be needed to clear the airway.

                <h2>Important Safety Tips</h2>
                <p>
                    Living without smell means you lose an important warning system. To
                    stay safe at home:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Install Detectors:</strong> Use smoke and gas detectors,
                        as you won't be able to smell smoke or leaks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Check Expiry Dates:</strong> Don't rely on the "sniff
                        test" for food. Read labels carefully to avoid eating spoiled
                        food.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Kitchen Safety:</strong> Be extra careful with gas stoves.
                        Ensure they are turned off completely after cooking.

                <h2>When to See a Doctor</h2>
                <p>
                    Don’t wait if your symptoms persist. You should book a consultation
                    if your loss of smell is sudden, unexplained, or lasts long after a
                    flu has cleared. Early diagnosis leads to better recovery.
