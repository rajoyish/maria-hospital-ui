                <h2>What Are Adenoids?</h2>
                <p>
                    Adenoids are small patches of tissue hidden high up in the throat,
                    just behind the nose. You cannot see them like you can see tonsils.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They are part of your child’s immune system. Their main job is to
                    act like a "filter" to trap germs and fight infections.
                </p>

                        <strong>Key Fact:</strong> Adenoids are largest in children aged 2
                        to 6. They usually shrink on their own by the teenage years.

                        Enlarged adenoids (adenoid hypertrophy) can block airflow behind
                        the nose, leading to mouth breathing, snoring, and sleep problems
                        in children. Maria Hospital in Kathmandu provides expert
                        evaluation and treatment options to help your child breathe and
                        sleep comfortably again.

                <h2>Why Do They Get Swollen?</h2>
                <p>
                    Adenoids naturally swell when fighting a cold or infection. Usually,
                    they shrink back down. However, sometimes they stay swollen due to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Recurring infections.</li>
                    <li>Allergies or pollution.</li>
                    <li>Genetics (some children are just born with larger ones).</li>

                <h2>Common Signs and Symptoms</h2>
                <p>
                    Since you cannot see adenoids, you must watch for the symptoms. If
                    your child has enlarged adenoids, they might block the air passage
                    behind the nose. Look for these signs:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Mouth Breathing:</strong> Your child breathes through
                        their mouth day and night because their nose feels blocked.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Loud Snoring:</strong> They may snore loudly or have
                        pauses in breathing during sleep (Sleep Apnea), leading to
                        tiredness during the day.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Ear Problems:</strong> Frequent ear infections or "glue
                        ear" (fluid buildup) can happen, sometimes affecting hearing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Nasal Voice:</strong> They sound like they have a
                        permanent cold.

                <h2>Diagnosis and Health Checkup at Maria Hospital</h2>
                <p>
                    If you suspect your child has this condition, a professional
                    <strong>doctor consultation</strong> is the first step. Because
                    adenoids are hidden, you cannot diagnose them at home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At Maria Hospital, our specialists use precise methods for accurate
                    diagnosis:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Physical Exam:</strong> We listen to your concerns about
                        snoring and breathing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Nasopharyngoscopy:</strong> A quick, gentle look at the
                        adenoids using a tiny camera tube.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>X-rays:</strong> To see the size of the adenoids and the
                        airway blockage.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <section>
                <h2>Effective Treatment Options</h2>
                <p>
                    Not every child needs surgery. Our goal is to find the right
                    treatment plan for your child’s specific needs.
                </p>

                <h3>1. Watchful Waiting</h3>
                <p>
                    For mild cases, we may simply monitor the condition during regular
                    health checkups, as adenoids often shrink with age.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Medications</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Nasal Sprays:</strong> To reduce swelling and
                        inflammation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Antibiotics:</strong> To treat bacterial infections.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Allergy Management:</strong> Medicine to help if allergies
                        are the cause.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Surgery (Adenoidectomy)</h3>
                <p>
                    If the symptoms are severe and affect your child’s sleep or hearing,
                    we may recommend a simple surgery to remove the adenoids.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Quick Procedure:</strong> It takes only 20–30 minutes
                        under general anesthesia.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>No Scars:</strong> The surgery is done through the mouth,
                        so there are no cuts on the skin.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Fast Recovery:</strong> Most children go home the same day
                        and recover within a week.
                    </li>
