                <p class="lead">Is your child ignoring you when you call their name? Are they turning the TV volume up
                    too high, or
                    acting
                    more irritable than usual?</p>

                <p class="lead">They might be suffering from a very common condition known as <strong>Secretory Otitis
                        Media</strong>, often
                    called <strong>"Glue Ear."</strong> This happens when fluid builds up inside the ear, even when
                    there is no
                    active infection.</p>

                <p class="lead">At <strong>Maria Hospital in Kathmandu</strong>, we understand how worrying hearing
                    issues can be for

                    Secretory Otitis Media
                    (Glue Ear), a common condition where fluid builds up in the middle ear without pain or infection.

                <h2>What is Glue Ear (Secretory Otitis Media)?</h2>
                <p>The middle ear is the space behind the eardrum. Usually, this space is filled with air, which helps
                    sound
                    travel to the brain. However, with Secretory Otitis Media, this space fills up with fluid.</p>
                <p>Unlike a painful ear infection, this fluid is not infected (no pus). It can be thick and sticky like
                    glue,
                    which is why it is called "Glue Ear." Because there is usually no pain or fever, many parents in
                    Nepal don't
                    realize their child has it until they notice behavioral changes.</p>

                    eardrum due to a blocked
                    Eustachian tube, affecting the normal movement of the ossicles and reducing hearing.

            <section>
                <h2>Why Does Fluid Build Up?</h2>
                <p>The main cause is a blockage in the tube that connects the ear to the throat (the Eustachian tube).
                    When this
                    tube gets blocked by swelling or mucus, fluid gets trapped.</p>
                <p><strong>Common causes include:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Recovering from a cold or flu:</strong> Congestion often blocks the ears.</li>
                    <li><strong>Previous ear infections:</strong> Fluid can stay behind long after the infection is
                        gone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Allergies:</strong> Very common in Kathmandu due to dust and pollen.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enlarged Adenoids:</strong> Swollen tissue in the throat that blocks drainage.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Signs and Symptoms to Watch For</h2>
                <p>Since Glue Ear is usually painless, you need to watch for changes in behavior. If you notice these
                    signs, it
                    may be time for a <strong>doctor consultation</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hearing difficulties:</strong> Your child frequently asks "What?" or needs you to repeat
                        things.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Volume issues:</strong> They watch cartoons or listen to music at a very high volume.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Speech delay:</strong> Young children may be slow to start talking or have unclear
                        speech.</li>
                    <li><strong>Balance issues:</strong> Clumsiness or unsteadiness when walking.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ear sensation:</strong> Older children may complain that their ear feels "full," pops,
                        or rings.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Who is Most at Risk?</h2>
                <p>While adults can get this, it is most common in children between <strong>6 months and 3 years
                        old</strong>.
                    Their ear tubes are smaller and flatter, making it harder for fluid to drain naturally. Risk factors
                    include
                    attending daycare, exposure to cigarette smoke, or bottle-feeding while lying flat.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Diagnosis at Maria Hospital</h2>
                <p>If you suspect your child has fluid in their ears, a professional <strong>health checkup</strong> is
                    necessary. At Maria Hospital, our specialists use advanced tools to provide an accurate diagnosis:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Visual Exam:</strong> We use a specialized light to look at the eardrum for fluid
                        bubbles or
                        color changes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pneumatic Test:</strong> We gently puff air into the ear to see if the eardrum moves
                        properly.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Tympanometry:</strong> A quick pressure test to confirm if fluid is blocking the drum.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Hearing Test:</strong> If the problem has lasted a long time, we check hearing levels to
                        ensure
                        no permanent damage is occurring.</li>
                </ol>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Treatment Options</h2>
                <p>The good news is that Glue Ear is usually temporary and treatable.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Watchful Waiting:</strong> In many cases, the fluid clears up on its own within 4 to 6
                        weeks. We
                        may monitor your child for a few months to see if it resolves naturally.</li>
                    <li><strong>Home Exercises:</strong> Older children can try "popping" their ears (gentle breathing
                        out while
                        pinching the nose) to open the tubes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Surgery (Ear Tubes):</strong> If the fluid lasts more than 3 months or affects speech
                        and school
                        performance, we may suggest a simple procedure. A tiny tube (grommet) is placed in the ear to
                        drain
                        fluid and let air in. This is a safe, routine procedure.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="border-l-4 border-warning bg-warning/10 p-3"><strong>Note:</strong> Antibiotics are
                    usually not effective for this specific condition unless
                    there is
                    also a new active infection.</p>
