                    Are you tired of frequent nosebleeds? We understand that seeing
                    blood can be scary, messy, and frustrating. While most nosebleeds
                    are not dangerous, having them happen again and again can disturb
                    your daily routine.

                        Recurrent nosebleeds (epistaxis) are often caused by dry air,
                        irritation, or infections. If bleeding happens frequently or does
                        not stop after 20 minutes of pressure, visit Maria Hospital in
                        Kathmandu for expert evaluation and safe treatment options like
                        nasal cautery or packing.

                <p>
                    A nosebleed (medically called <em>epistaxis</em>) happens when the
                    tiny blood vessels inside your nose break.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Front Nosebleeds:</strong> Most cases happen in the front
                        part of the nose. This area is very delicate and easy to irritate.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Deep Nosebleeds:</strong> These occur deep in the back of
                        the nose. They are less common but can be more serious, especially
                        for older adults.

                <p>
                    If your nose bleeds often, the lining inside might be dry or
                    damaged. Here are the most common causes:

                        Most nosebleeds (epistaxis) occur in the front part of the nose
                        where delicate blood vessels can easily break due to dryness,
                        irritation, or infection. If bleeding is frequent or hard to
                        control, Maria Hospital in Kathmandu provides expert evaluation
                        and advanced treatment options.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Dry Air:</strong> The air in <strong>Nepal</strong> can
                            get very dry, especially during winter or when using indoor
                            heaters. This causes the skin inside your nose to crack and
                            bleed.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Nasal Sprays:</strong> Using allergy or decongestant
                            sprays too often can thin out the nasal tissue.
                        </li>

                            <strong>Nose Picking:</strong> This is a common cause in
                            children. It damages the healing skin, making the bleed start
                            all over again.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Blowing Too Hard:</strong> Forcefully blowing or rubbing
                            your nose can trigger bleeding.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Infections:</strong> Colds, sinus infections, and
                            allergies cause swelling that makes blood vessels burst easily.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Medications:</strong> Blood-thinning medicines (like
                            aspirin) make it harder for bleeding to stop.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Health Conditions:</strong> While rare, conditions like
                            high blood pressure or clotting disorders can make nosebleeds
                            last longer. A proper <strong>diagnosis</strong> is key to
                            ruling these out.

                <h2>Immediate First Aid: How to Stop a Nosebleed</h2>
                <p>
                    If your nose starts bleeding, stay calm and follow these 4 steps:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Sit Up and Lean Forward:</strong> Do <em>not</em> tilt
                        your head back or lie down. Leaning back causes blood to flow
                        down your throat, which can make you sick.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Pinch the Soft Part:</strong> Use your thumb and finger
                        to firmly pinch the soft, lower part of your nose (nostrils).
                        Press against the hard bone in the middle.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Time It:</strong> Hold this pressure for
                        <strong>10 to 15 minutes</strong> (5 minutes for children). Do
                        not let go to check if it has stopped until the time is fully up.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Stay Cool:</strong> Place an ice pack on your nose or the
                        back of your neck to help stop the flow.
                    </li>

                <h2>How to Prevent Future Nosebleeds</h2>
                <p>
                    To stop the cycle of bleeding, you need to keep your nose moist and
                    let it heal.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Moisturize:</strong> Apply a saline spray or a small
                        amount of Vaseline inside your nostrils to prevent cracking.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Humidify:</strong> Use a humidifier in your bedroom to
                        keep the air moist, especially during
                        <strong>Kathmandu's</strong> dry winters.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Be Gentle:</strong> Keep children’s fingernails short and
                        avoid blowing your nose hard for at least a week after a bleed.
                    </li>
