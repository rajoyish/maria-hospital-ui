                    Constant sneezing, a runny nose, and nasal congestion can be caused
                    by colds, allergies, or pollution. If symptoms persist for more than
                    10 days or come with fever or facial pain, visit Maria Hospital in
                    Kathmandu for proper diagnosis and treatment.

                <h2>What Is Happening to Your Nose?</h2>
                <p>
                    Sneezing, a runny nose, and congestion often happen at the same
                    time, but they are actually different ways your body protects
                    itself:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Sneezing:</strong> This is your body’s reflex to kick out
                        "intruders" like dust, pollen, or viruses from your nose.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Runny Nose:</strong> Your body produces extra mucus
                        (liquid) to wash away germs. It’s a sign your immune system is
                        working hard.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Nasal Congestion (Stuffy Nose):</strong> Many people think
                        this is just a blockage of mucus. However, it is actually caused
                        by the <strong>swelling</strong> of tissues inside your nose. This
                        narrows your airways, making it hard to breathe.

                    Frequent sneezing, runny nose, and nasal congestion are common
                    symptoms of colds, flu, or allergies. If these symptoms last more
                    than 10 days, cause high fever, or include facial pain, seek a
                    proper health checkup at Maria Hospital in Kathmandu for safe and
                    effective treatment.

                <h2>Common Causes of Nasal Symptoms</h2>
                <p>
                    Your nose acts as a filter for the air you breathe. Because of this,
                    many things can trigger symptoms. Here are the most common causes we
                    see during a <strong>doctor consultation</strong> at Maria Hospital:

                        <figcaption>
                            Swelling of the nasal lining and excess mucus production can
                            lead to sneezing, runny nose, and congestion. Identifying
                            whether the cause is a viral infection, allergy, or
                            environmental irritant is key to getting the right treatment at
                            Maria Hospital in Kathmandu.

                    <p>
                        The most common causes are the common cold, the flu, or COVID-19.
                        Your body creates inflammation and mucus to trap the virus.

                        Sometimes, your nose is simply irritated by your surroundings.

                            <strong>Cold Air:</strong> Dry, cold air can dry out your nose,
                            causing it to run.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Pollution and Smoke:</strong> The dust in Kathmandu,
                            vehicle smoke, or strong perfumes can trigger sneezing.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Spicy Food:</strong> Eating hot or spicy Nepali food can
                            sometimes make your nose run immediately.

                <p>
                    In many cases, these symptoms will go away on their own. You can try
                    these simple home remedies to feel better:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Stay Hydrated:</strong> Drink plenty of water to keep
                        mucus thin and easy to drain.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Use Saline Rinses:</strong> Saltwater sprays are safe and
                        effective for washing out dust and allergens.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Humidifiers:</strong> Using a humidifier adds moisture to
                        the air, which helps soothe dry nasal passages.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Avoid Triggers:</strong> If you have allergies, try to
                        wear a mask in dusty areas and keep windows closed during
                        high-pollen seasons.

                    While a stuffy nose is usually not dangerous, sometimes you need
                    professional medical care. You should book a
                    <strong>health checkup</strong> or doctor consultation at Maria
