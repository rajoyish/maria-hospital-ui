                    Do you often feel like one side of your nose is blocked? Do you
                    struggle with snoring or frequent sinus infections? You might have a
                    condition called <strong>Deviated Nasal Septum (DNS)</strong>. While
                    this sounds complex, it is actually very common.

                    At <strong>Maria Hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal</strong>, we are here
                    to help you understand this condition and find the right treatment

                    A deviated nasal septum (DNS) occurs when the wall dividing the
                    nostrils is bent, narrowing one side and blocking airflow. If you
                    experience persistent nasal blockage, snoring, or repeated sinus
                    infections, Maria Hospital in Kathmandu offers expert diagnosis and
                    treatment, including septoplasty when needed.

                <h2>What is the Nasal Septum?</h2>
                <p>
                    Think of your nose as a house with two rooms. The "nasal septum" is
                    the wall that divides these two rooms (your nostrils). It is made of
                    bone and cartilage. Ideally, this wall should be straight, making
                    both sides of your nose the same size.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>What is a Deviated Nasal Septum (DNS)?</h2>
                <p>
                    A "deviated" septum simply means the wall is crooked or bent to one
                    side. This makes one nasal passage smaller than the other, which can
                    block airflow and make breathing difficult.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Did you know?</strong> It is very rare to have a perfectly
                    straight nose. About 80% of people have some bend in their septum.
                    For many, it causes no issues. However, if the bend is severe, it
                    requires medical attention.

                    <figcaption>
                        An S-shaped deviated septum can block normal airflow, leading to
                        nasal congestion, snoring, and frequent sinus infections. If
                        breathing difficulty persists, Maria Hospital in Kathmandu
                        provides expert evaluation and treatment options, including
                        septoplasty for lasting relief.

                <h2>Why Does It Happen?</h2>
                <p>There are a few reasons why your septum might be crooked:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Born with it:</strong> Some babies are born with a
                        deviated septum due to the way the nose developed in the womb.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Injury or Trauma:</strong> A hit to the nose from sports,
                        a fall, or a traffic accident is a common cause.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Aging:</strong> As we get older, our nasal structures
                        change, which can make a slight bend worse over time.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                <h2>Common Signs and Symptoms</h2>
                <p>
                    How do you know if you need a doctor consultation? Look out for
                    these symptoms:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Blocked Nose:</strong> Difficulty breathing through one or
                        both nostrils.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Nosebleeds:</strong> The bent area can become dry and
                        crack easily.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Snoring &amp; Noisy Breathing:</strong> A narrowed airway
                        often leads to loud snoring or sleep issues.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Headaches:</strong> Pressure inside the nose can cause
                        facial pain.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Recurring Sinus Infections:</strong> If your nose cannot
                        drain properly, you may get sick often.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Diagnosis and Treatment at Maria Hospital</h2>
                <p>
                    If you are suffering from these symptoms, it is time for a health
                    checkup at Maria Hospital. Ignoring the problem can lead to chronic
                    sleep issues and sinus trouble.
                </p>

                <h3>How we check you:</h3>
                <p>
                    Our specialists in Kathmandu use safe, modern methods to provide an
                    accurate diagnosis:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Physical Exam:</strong> We gently look inside your nose.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Nasal Endoscopy:</strong> We use a tiny camera to see deep
                        inside your nasal passages.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>CT Scan:</strong> If needed, we take detailed images of
                        your nasal bones.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How we treat you:</h3>
                <p>Your treatment depends on how much the condition bothers you.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Medicine (Non-Surgical):</strong> For mild cases, we may
                        prescribe sprays or decongestants to reduce swelling and help you
                        breathe.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Septoplasty (Surgery):</strong> If medicine doesn't help,
                        we may suggest a minor surgery called Septoplasty. This procedure
                        straightens the wall inside your nose. It is done entirely inside
                        the nostrils, so there are no visible scars on your face.
                    </li>
                </ol>
