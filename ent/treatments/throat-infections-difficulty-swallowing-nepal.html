                    Swallowing is something we do hundreds of times a day without thinking. But when it becomes painful
                    or difficult, it can feel scary and uncomfortable. At <strong>Maria Hospital in Kathmandu,
                        Nepal</strong>, our goal is to help you understand why this happens, how to spot a serious
                    infection, and when it is time to seek a <strong>doctor consultation</strong> for proper care.

                        Painful swallowing (odynophagia) or the feeling of food getting stuck (dysphagia) can be caused
                        by throat infections like viral sore throat, strep throat, or tonsillitis. If pain is severe,
                        lasts more than a week, or comes with fever or breathing difficulty, seek medical care at Maria
                        Hospital in Kathmandu.

                <h2>Why Does Swallowing Hurt?</h2>
                <p>Doctors use two main terms to describe these uncomfortable symptoms:</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt><strong>Dysphagia</strong></dt>
                    <dd>The feeling that food or liquid is stuck in your throat or chest, or that it takes extra effort
                        to swallow.</dd>

                    <dt><strong>Odynophagia</strong></dt>
                    <dd>Sharp pain when swallowing that happens in your mouth, throat, or food pipe.</dd>
                </dl>
                <p>While everyday issues like acid reflux can cause discomfort, sudden pain and swallowing trouble are
                    very often caused by a throat infection.</p>

                <h2>Common Throat Infections That Affect Swallowing</h2>
                <p>If your throat hurts when you swallow, inflammation is likely the cause. Here are the most common
                    reasons you might be feeling pain:</p>

                <h3>1. Viral Infections (Colds and Flu)</h3>
                <p>Viruses are the leading cause of a sore throat. If you also have a runny nose, cough, and are
                    sneezing, a viral infection is likely to blame. These usually clear up on their own within a week.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Strep Throat</h3>
                <p>This is a bacterial infection that requires a professional <strong>diagnosis</strong> and medical
                    <strong>treatment</strong>. Unlike a common cold, strep throat usually does not cause a cough or
                    runny nose.
                </p>

                <p>Watch out for these signs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sudden, severe sore throat</li>
                    <li>Fever</li>
                    <li>Swollen, tender lymph nodes in your neck</li>
                    <li>White patches or streaks of pus on your tonsils</li>
                    <li>Tiny red spots on the roof of your mouth</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><a href="/treatments/tonsillitis-recurrent-sore-throat-nepal">3. Tonsillitis</a></h3>
                <p>This is the painful swelling of your tonsils (the two soft pads at the back of your throat). Caused
                    by either viruses or bacteria, symptoms include red tonsils, bad breath, fever, and sharp pain when
                    you swallow.</p>

                <h3>4. Fungal Infections (Thrush)</h3>
                <p>Sometimes, a yeast infection called oral thrush can develop in the throat, especially for people with
                    weakened immune systems. Symptoms include a cotton-like feeling in your mouth, loss of taste, and
                    white patches on your tongue or inner cheeks.</p>

                <h3>5. Epiglottitis (A Medical Emergency)</h3>
                <p>This is a rare but highly dangerous infection that affects the flap protecting your windpipe,
                    potentially blocking your airway. Symptoms include a sudden, severe sore throat, high fever, a
                    muffled voice, and drooling because swallowing saliva is too painful. Seek emergency care
                    immediately if you notice these signs.</p>

                <h2>Other Reasons You Might Struggle to Swallow</h2>
                <p>If you do not have a fever or feel sick, a <strong>health checkup</strong> might reveal other common
                    causes, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Acid Reflux (GERD):</strong> Stomach acid backing up can irritate your throat and make
                        it feel like there is a lump in it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Throat Injury:</strong> Scratching your throat on sharp or very hot food.</li>
                    <li><strong>Allergies:</strong> Swelling or post-nasal drip from allergic reactions can severely
                        irritate the throat.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                <h2>Simple Home Remedies to Soothe Your Throat</h2>
                <p>If your swallowing difficulty is caused by a mild cold, these home care tips can help you feel
                    better:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stay Hydrated:</strong> Drink plenty of fluids. Warm liquids like broth or tea with
                        honey can soothe the throat, while cool drinks can help numb the pain.</li>
                    <li><strong>Salt Water Gargle:</strong> Mix half a teaspoon of salt into a glass of warm water and
                        gargle to reduce swelling and clear away bacteria.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidify the Air:</strong> Use a humidifier or breathe in steam to keep your throat from
                        drying out.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Pain Relievers:</strong> Over-the-counter medicines like paracetamol or ibuprofen can
                        help reduce fever and pain.
                        <p class="border-l-4 border-warning bg-warning/10 p-3"><strong>Note:</strong> Never give aspirin
                            to children or teenagers.</p>
                    </li>

                <h2>When to Visit Maria Hospital</h2>
                <p>Most sore throats heal naturally, but some require a doctor's help. You should visit us for a checkup
                    if:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your pain is severe or lasts longer than one week.</li>
                    <li>You have difficulty breathing or opening your mouth.</li>
                    <li>You see white patches or pus at the back of your throat.</li>
                    <li>You have a fever higher than 38.3°C.</li>
                    <li>You experience joint pain, earaches, or a rash.</li>
                    <li>You notice blood in your saliva or phlegm.
                        <p class="border-l-4 border-warning bg-warning/10 p-3">Seek immediate emergency care if your
                            child is
                            drooling excessively (a sign they cannot swallow), is struggling to breathe, or prefers to
                            sit
                            upright to catch their breath.</p>
