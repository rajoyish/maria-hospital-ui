                    Do you feel like you have a cold that just won’t go away? If you are
                    dealing with constant sneezing, a runny nose, or itchy eyes, you
                    might not be sick with a virus. You may have
                    <strong>Allergic Rhinitis</strong>, also known as nasal allergies or
                    hay fever.

                    Living in Nepal, especially in busy cities like Kathmandu, dust and
                    pollution are part of daily life. However, distinguishing between a
                    common cold and an allergy is the first step to feeling better. This
                    article from Maria Hospital will help you understand what causes
                    these allergies and how our doctors can help you treat them.

                    Frequent sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes are common signs of
                    allergic rhinitis (hay fever). In dusty environments like Kathmandu,
                    proper diagnosis and treatment at Maria Hospital can help you
                    control symptoms and breathe comfortably again.

                <h2>What is Allergic Rhinitis?</h2>
                <p>
                    Allergic rhinitis is inflammation in your nose. It happens when your
                    immune system gets confused. It treats harmless things in the
                    air—like dust, pollen, or pet fur—as dangerous invaders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you breathe these in, your body fights back by releasing
                    chemicals (like histamine). This reaction causes the swelling,
                    itching, and sneezing you feel. It is very common among both adults
                    and children in Nepal.
                </p>

                    alt="Medical illustration of a side view of the nasal passages with airborne allergens like pollen and dust particles entering the nose and triggering inflammation." />
                <figcaption>
                    Allergic rhinitis occurs when airborne triggers such as dust,
                    pollen, and mites enter the nose and cause inflammation, sneezing,
                    and congestion. Identifying your allergy triggers and getting proper
                    treatment at Maria Hospital can help you manage symptoms
                    effectively.

                <p>
                    Understanding what triggers your sneezing is key to a correct
                    diagnosis.
                </p>

                <h3>1. Seasonal Allergies (Hay Fever)</h3>
                <p>
                    These happen at specific times of the year when plants release
                    pollen.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Tree pollen.</li>
                    <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Grass pollen.</li>
                    <li><strong>Autumn:</strong> Weed pollen.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Year-Round Allergies</h3>
                <p>
                    These happen anytime and are caused by indoor triggers common in
                    Nepali homes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Dust Mites:</strong> Tiny bugs living in carpets and
                        bedding.

                    <li>

                        cats.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Mold:</strong> Found in damp areas like bathrooms or

                    we help identify the exact cause.
                </p>
                <ul>

                        <strong>Physical Exam:</strong> A doctor will check your nose and
