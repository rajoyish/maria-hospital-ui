                    Nasal polyps are soft, non-cancerous growths inside the nose or sinuses that can block airflow and
                    reduce
                    your sense of smell. If you have long-lasting nasal blockage or facial pressure, Maria Hospital in

                <h2>What Are Nasal Polyps?</h2>
                <p>
                    Nasal polyps are soft, painless growths inside your nose or sinuses. They often look like small
                    teardrops or
                    grapes. They are benign (not cancer) and do not increase your risk of cancer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Small polyps might not bother you at all. However, if they grow larger or form in groups, they can
                    block
                    your nasal passages. This makes it hard to breathe, smell, or sleep comfortably.
                </p>

                <h2>Common Signs and Symptoms</h2>
                <p>
                    Since polyps grow slowly, many people in Nepal mistake them for a long-lasting cold or seasonal
                    allergies.
                    You should consider a doctor consultation if you have:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Blocked or stuffy nose:</strong> The most annoying symptom that doesn't get better.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Runny nose:</strong> Constant mucus dripping down the back of your throat (postnasal
                        drip).
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Loss of smell or taste:</strong> Food might taste bland, or you can’t smell properly.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Facial pressure:</strong> Feeling fullness or mild pain in your forehead and face.</li>
                    <li><strong>Snoring:</strong> Trouble breathing at night can lead to poor sleep.</li>
                </ul>
                <aside>
                    <p class="border-l-4 border-warning bg-warning/10 p-3">
                        <strong>Note:</strong> If these symptoms last for more than 12 weeks, it is likely chronic
                        rhinosinusitis
                        with nasal polyps.

                <h2>Why Do They Happen?</h2>
                <p>
                    Doctors aren't 100% sure why some people get them, but they are caused by long-term (chronic)
                    inflammation
                    in the nose. They are most common in adults aged 30 to 40.
                </p>
                <p>You might be at higher risk if you have:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Asthma</li>
                    <li>Frequent sinus infections</li>
                    <li>Allergies (Hay Fever)</li>
                    <li>Sensitivity to Aspirin</li>
                    <li>Cystic Fibrosis</li>

                <h2>Diagnosis at Maria Hospital</h2>
                <p>
                    If you are worried about your symptoms, a quick health checkup at Maria Hospital can give you
                    answers. Our
                    specialists in Kathmandu use simple methods to provide an accurate diagnosis:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Physical Exam:</strong> We look inside your nose with a simple light.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Nasal Endoscopy:</strong> We use a tiny camera tube to look deep inside your sinuses
                        (it’s quick
                        and generally painless).
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>CT Scan:</strong> For a detailed view of the size and location of the polyps.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Effective Treatment Options</h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to reduce the size of the polyps or remove them completely. Here is how we treat them:
                </p>

                <h3>1. Medications</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Nasal Sprays:</strong> Steroid sprays are often the first step to reduce swelling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Oral Medication:</strong> Short courses of pills can help shrink polyps quickly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Biologics:</strong> New, advanced injections for stubborn cases.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Saline Rinses</h3>
                <p>
                    Washing your nose with a sterile saltwater solution helps clear mucus and irritants, helping you
                    feel fresher
                    immediately.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Surgery</h3>
                <p>
                    If medicine doesn't work, we may suggest <strong>Endoscopic Sinus Surgery</strong>. This is a modern
                    procedure available at Maria Hospital. It is usually done without any cuts on the outside of your
                    face,
                    allowing for a faster recovery.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2>When Should You See a Doctor?</h2>
                <p>Don't suffer in silence. You should book an appointment if symptoms last longer than 10 days.</p>
                <p><strong>Seek immediate help if you experience:</strong></p>
