                <p class="lead">Seeing fluid drain from your ear—or your child’s ear—can be scary. This condition, known
                    medically as
                    <em>otorrhea</em> (or simply "runny ear"), is very common in Nepal. While it is often just earwax or
                    trapped
                    water, sometimes it can be a sign of an infection that needs medical attention.

                    Ear discharge can be alarming, but it is often treatable once the cause is identified. Whether due
                    to infection, trapped
                    fluid, or injury, timely medical consultation helps prevent complications such as hearing loss and
                    ensures safe,
                    effective treatment.

                <h2>What is Ear Discharge?</h2>
                <p>Ear discharge is any fluid that leaks out of the ear canal. The color of the fluid can tell you a lot
                    about
                    what is happening inside your ear:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Earwax (Brown/Orange):</strong> This is natural. Your body makes wax to protect the ear.
                        If it
                        gets wet or melts in the heat, it might look like a runny discharge, but it is usually harmless.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Pus or Cloudy Fluid (White/Yellow/Green):</strong> If the fluid is thick or smells bad,
                        it
                        usually signals an infection. You should seek a <strong>diagnosis</strong> from a doctor.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clear Watery Fluid:</strong> This is often water trapped after a bath or swimming, or
                        sometimes
                        tears that flowed into the ear.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bloody Fluid:</strong> This often means a minor scratch inside the ear, perhaps from
                        cleaning it
                        too roughly.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                <figcaption>
                    Ear discharge (otorrhea) can occur when infection causes fluid to build up in the middle ear and
                    rupture the eardrum.
                    While this may temporarily relieve pressure and pain, medical evaluation is essential to treat the
                    infection properly
                    and allow the eardrum to heal safely.

                <h2>Common Causes of Ear Discharge</h2>
                <p>Most discharge comes from the ear canal or the middle ear (the space behind your eardrum).</p>

                <h3>1. Ear Infections</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Middle Ear Infection:</strong> Bacteria or viruses can cause fluid to build up behind
                        the
                        eardrum. If the pressure gets too high, the eardrum may tear (rupture). This releases the fluid
                        (pus)
                        and often stops the pain, but it requires medical treatment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Swimmer’s Ear:</strong> If water stays in the ear after swimming or bathing, bacteria
                        can grow.
                        This causes the ear canal to swell and weep fluid.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Injury or Trauma</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cleaning:</strong> Using cotton swabs (Q-tips), matchsticks, or feathers to clean ears
                        is common
                        but dangerous. It can scratch the ear or push wax deeper.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pressure Changes:</strong> Flying or diving can sometimes affect the eardrum.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Foreign Objects</h3>
                <p>Children often put small objects like beads, food, or toy parts in their ears. This can lead to
                    infection and
                    discharge.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>How to Care for a Leaking Ear at Home</h2>
                <p>If you notice discharge, follow these steps to keep the ear clean and safe until you can visit
                    <strong>Maria
                        Hospital</strong>.
                </p>

                <h3>The "Wicking" Method (Safe Cleaning)</h3>
                <p>Do not put anything deep inside the ear. Instead, use this method:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Wash your hands thoroughly.</li>
                    <li>Twist a piece of soft, absorbent tissue into a pointed "wick" shape.</li>
                    <li>Gently place the tip into the outer ear canal (do not push deep).</li>
                    <li>Let it soak up the fluid for a minute, then replace it with a clean one.</li>
                    <li>Repeat until the tissue comes out dry.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Important Do’s and Don’ts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>DO</strong> keep the ear dry. Avoid swimming. When bathing, be careful not to let water
                        enter
                        the ear.</li>
                    <li><strong>DO NOT</strong> use cotton buds (Q-tips) inside the ear. They can damage the eardrum.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>DO NOT</strong> block the ear with cotton wool unless a doctor tells you to.</li>
                    <li><strong>DO NOT</strong> pour oil or water into the ear if you think the eardrum might be burst.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                <h2>When to See a Doctor</h2>
                <p>Some minor issues heal on their own, but you should visit <strong>Maria Hospital</strong> for a
