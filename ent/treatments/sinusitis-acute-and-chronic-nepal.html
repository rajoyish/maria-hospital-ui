                    <strong>Sinusitis</strong>, commonly known as a sinus infection, affects many people in
                    <strong>Nepal</strong> every year, especially with the changing weather and pollution levels in
                    cities like
                    <strong>Kathmandu</strong>.

                    Sinusitis can cause facial pressure, blocked nose, and thick nasal discharge—the common “Three Ps”
                    (Pus, Pressure,
                    Plugged). If symptoms persist in Kathmandu’s dusty environment, visit Maria Hospital for proper
                    diagnosis and effective
                    treatment.

            <section>
                <h2>What is Sinusitis?</h2>
                <p>Your sinuses are hollow, air-filled spaces behind your forehead, cheekbones, and nose. When these
                    spaces are
                    healthy, air flows through them easily. However, when the tissues lining them become swollen or
                    blocked with
                    fluid, germs can grow and cause an infection.</p>
                <p>Doctors generally divide sinusitis into three types based on how long it lasts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Acute Sinusitis:</strong> Usually starts like a common cold and lasts less than 4 weeks.
                        Most of
                        these are caused by viruses and go away on their own.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chronic Sinusitis:</strong> A long-term condition where symptoms last for more than 12
                        weeks.
                        This is often caused by long-lasting inflammation (swelling).</li>
                    <li><strong>Recurrent Acute Sinusitis:</strong> When you get a sinus infection four or more times in
                        a
                        single year.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Common Symptoms: The "Three Ps"</h2>
                <p>Sinusitis can make you feel tired and miserable. To spot it easily, remember the <strong>"Three
                        Ps"</strong>:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Pus:</strong> Thick yellow or green mucus coming from your nose or dripping down your
                        throat.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Pressure:</strong> Pain or tenderness around your eyes, cheeks, and forehead (often
                        worse when
                        you bend down).</li>
                    <li><strong>Plugged:</strong> A blocked or stuffy nose that makes breathing difficult.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Other signs to watch for include:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduced sense of smell or taste.</li>
                    <li>Fever and bad breath.</li>
                    <li>Upper tooth pain.</li>
                    <li>Coughing (which may get worse at night).</li>
                </ul>

                    become inflamed or
                    blocked in sinusitis, causing facial pressure, congestion, and headache. Proper evaluation at Maria
                    Hospital helps
                    determine the right treatment for acute or chronic sinus infection.

                <h2>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
                <p>While a viral cold is the most common cause, other factors can lead to sinus problems. In the dusty
                    environment of <strong>Kathmandu, Nepal</strong>, these triggers are very common:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Allergies:</strong> Dust, pollen, and pollution can trigger swelling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nasal Polyps:</strong> Small growths inside the nose that block airflow.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deviated Septum:</strong> A crooked wall between your nostrils that causes blockage.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Smoking:</strong> Smoke irritates the nose and increases infection risk.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Effective Treatment Options</h2>
                <p>The right treatment depends on whether your infection is new (acute) or long-term (chronic).</p>

                <h3>1. Home Remedies and Self-Care</h3>
                <p>For mild cases, you can often treat symptoms at home:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Saline Irrigation (Jala Neti):</strong> Rinse your nasal passages with a neti pot or
                        saline
                        spray to clear out dust and mucus.</li>
                    <li><strong>Steam Inhalation:</strong> Breathe in steam from a bowl of hot water to open your
                        blocked nose.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Stay Hydrated:</strong> Drink plenty of warm water and soups.</li>
                    <li><strong>Warm Compresses:</strong> Put a warm, damp towel on your face to reduce pain.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Medical Treatment</h3>
                <p>If home remedies don't help, a <strong>doctor consultation</strong> is necessary. Treatments may
                    include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Decongestants:</strong> To briefly help with a blocked nose (do not use for more than
                        3-5 days).
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Nasal Sprays:</strong> Steroid sprays to reduce swelling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Antibiotics:</strong> These are <em>only</em> needed if bacteria are causing the
                        infection. Your
                        doctor will decide if you need them based on a proper <strong>health checkup</strong>.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Chronic Care</h3>
                <p>If your sinusitis lasts for months, you may need to see an ENT (Ear, Nose, and Throat) specialist at
                    <strong>Maria Hospital</strong>. We offer advanced care, including procedures to open sinus pathways
                    if
                    medication alone does not work.
