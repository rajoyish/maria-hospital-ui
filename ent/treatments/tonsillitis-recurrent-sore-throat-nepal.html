                        Severe throat pain, difficulty swallowing, and swollen glands can be signs of tonsillitis. If
                        sore throats
                        keep coming back or are accompanied by fever, visit Maria Hospital in Kathmandu for proper
                        diagnosis and
                        effective treatment options, including antibiotics or tonsillectomy when needed.

                    <figcaption>
                        Tonsillitis causes the tonsils to become red, swollen, and sometimes covered with white patches.
                        If you
                        experience severe throat pain, fever, or difficulty swallowing, Maria Hospital in Kathmandu
                        provides
                        accurate diagnosis and effective treatment to prevent recurrent infections.

                <p>
                    Your tonsils are the two small, oval pads of tissue at the back of your throat. They act as "guards"
                    for
                    your immune system, trapping germs that enter through your nose and mouth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, these guards get overwhelmed by bacteria or viruses. When this happens, they become
                    swollen, red,
                    and painful. This infection is called tonsillitis. While it is very common in children, adults in
                    Nepal
                    suffer from it too.

                <h2>Common Symptoms: How to Tell if You Have It</h2>
                <p>Symptoms often appear suddenly. You might need a health checkup if you notice:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Severe throat pain:</strong> It hurts to swallow water or food.</li>
                    <li><strong>Swollen tonsils:</strong> They look red or have white/yellow spots.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fever:</strong> A temperature of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher.</li>
                    <li><strong>Swollen glands:</strong> The sides of your neck feel tender.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bad breath:</strong> Caused by the infection hiding in the tonsils.</li>
                    <li><strong>Voice changes:</strong> Your voice sounds scratchy or muffled.</li>
                </ul>
                <aside>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Note for Parents:</strong> If your young child is refusing to eat, drooling excessively,
                        or acting
                        unusually fussy, they may have a sore throat they cannot tell you about.

                <h2>Why Does My Sore Throat Keep Coming Back?</h2>
                <p>
                    Many patients visit Maria Hospital asking why their throat pain never seems to go away completely.
                    This is
                    often due to <strong>Recurrent Tonsillitis</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bacteria can sometimes create a hiding spot called a "biofilm" on your tonsils. This film protects
                    the germs
                    from antibiotics and your immune system. When you get tired, stressed, or catch a small cold, these
                    hidden
                    bacteria "wake up" and cause a new infection.
                </p>
                <p>Other triggers can include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Seasonal allergies</li>
                    <li>Pollution or smoking</li>
                    <li>Acid reflux (Gastric issues)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Diagnosis and Treatment at Maria Hospital</h2>
                <p>
                    To treat you properly, our doctors first need to know if your infection is caused by a virus or
                    bacteria.
                </p>

                <h3>1. Accurate Diagnosis</h3>
                <p>When you come for a doctor consultation at Maria Hospital in Kathmandu, we may perform:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Physical Exam:</strong> Checking for swelling and redness.</li>
                    <li><strong>Throat Swab:</strong> A quick test to check for "Strep throat" bacteria.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Effective Treatment Options</h3>
                <p>Once we know the cause, we create a personalized plan for you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Home Care (For Viral Infections):</strong> If it is a virus, antibiotics won't help. We
                        recommend
                        rest, hydration (plenty of warm water or soup), and salt-water gargles.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Antibiotics (For Bacterial Infections):</strong> If you have a bacterial infection, we
                        will
                        prescribe antibiotics.
                        <em>Important: You must finish the full course of medicine to prevent the infection from
                            returning.</em>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Surgery (Tonsillectomy):</strong> If you suffer from severe, frequent infections or
                        breathing
                        issues (snoring/sleep apnea), we may recommend removing the tonsils. Modern surgery at Maria
                        Hospital is
                        safe, quick, and usually allows you to go home the same day.
                    </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Your sore throat lasts more than 2 days.</li>

                    <li>The problem keeps coming back.</li>
