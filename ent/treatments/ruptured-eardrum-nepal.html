            <p class="lead">A perforated eardrum—commonly known as a <strong>ruptured eardrum</strong>—is a small hole
                or tear in the
                thin
                tissue separating your outer ear from your middle ear.</p>

            <p class="lead">Think of your eardrum like the skin of a drum. It has two vital jobs:</p>
            <ul class="text-xl">
                <li>It vibrates to help you hear clearly.</li>
                <li>It acts as a shield to keep water, bacteria, and dust out of your inner ear.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="lead">If this barrier breaks, it can affect your hearing and lead to infections. At <strong>Maria
                    Hospital in
                    Kathmandu, Nepal</strong>, we provide expert <strong>doctor consultation</strong> and care to help
                your ear
                heal safely.</p>

                <h2>Common Signs and Symptoms</h2>
                <p>You might not always know right away that your eardrum has torn. However, if you notice these signs,
                    it is
                    time for a <strong>health checkup</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong><a href="/treatments/ear-pain-nepal">Sudden Ear Pain</a>:</strong> A sharp pain that may
                        subside quickly (often because the
                        pressure from
                        infection has been released).</li>
                    <li><strong>Drainage:</strong> You might see clear fluid, pus, or even a little blood leaking from
                        the ear.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong><a href="/treatments/hearing-loss-nepal">Hearing Issues</a>:</strong> Sounds may feel
                        muffled, or you might have trouble hearing
                        clearly.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong><a href="/treatments/tinnitus-nepal">Ringing Sound (Tinnitus)</a>:</strong> A buzzing or
                        humming noise in the ear.</li>
                    <li><strong><a
                                href="/treatments/vertigo-dizziness-and-balance-disorders-nepal">Dizziness</a>:</strong>
                        You may feel like the room is spinning (vertigo) or feel nauseous.

                <h2>Why Does This Happen?</h2>
                <p>A ruptured eardrum can happen to anyone, from children to adults. The most common causes we see
                    include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Middle Ear Infections:</strong> This is the #1 cause. Infection causes fluid to build
                        up,
                        creating pressure that eventually bursts the eardrum to release the fluid.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cotton Swabs & Objects:</strong> Cleaning your ears with cotton buds, hairpins, or
                        matchsticks
                        is dangerous. These can easily poke a hole in the delicate membrane.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pressure Changes:</strong> Rapid changes in air pressure—like flying on a plane or
                        driving
                        through high hills in Nepal—can stress the ear.</li>
                    <li><strong>Loud Noises:</strong> Extremely loud sounds, such as blasts or very loud music, can
                        damage the
                        ear.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Diagnosis at Maria Hospital</h2>
                <p>To find out if you have a rupture, you need a proper <strong>diagnosis</strong>. When you visit
                    <strong>Maria
                        Hospital</strong>, our doctors will look inside your ear using a special light called an
                    <strong>otoscope</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>If needed, we may recommend further tests:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Audiometry:</strong> A simple test to measure your hearing levels.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lab Tests:</strong> If there is discharge, we check for bacteria to prescribe the right
                        medicine.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Treatment Options: Will I Need Surgery?</h2>
                <p>The good news is that <strong>most ruptured eardrums heal on their own within a few weeks</strong>
                    without
                    surgery. Our goal is to manage the pain and prevent infection while your body heals.</p>

                <h3>1. Non-Surgical Care (Most Common)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Observation:</strong> We will monitor your progress to ensure the hole is closing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Medication:</strong> We may prescribe antibiotic drops or pills if there is an
                        infection. Pain
                        relievers can help you feel comfortable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Keeping it Dry:</strong> You must keep water out of your ear to prevent complications.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Procedures and Surgery</h3>
                <p>If the hole is large or doesn't heal after two months, we may suggest:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Eardrum Patch:</strong> A simple procedure where the doctor places a small paper patch
                        over the
                        hole to help tissue grow across it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tympanoplasty (Surgery):</strong> For holes that won't close, a surgeon grafts a tiny
                        piece of
                        your own tissue to close the hole permanently.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Home Care: How to Protect Your Ear</h2>
                <p>While recovering at home, follow these simple tips:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Keep it Dry:</strong> Avoid swimming. When showering, place a cotton ball coated in
                        Vaseline
                        (petroleum jelly) in your outer ear to seal out water.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stop Cleaning Inside:</strong> Do not put cotton swabs or oil drops inside your ear
                        unless your
                        doctor tells you to.</li>
                    <li><strong>Be Gentle:</strong> Avoid blowing your nose hard, as the pressure can damage the healing
                        ear.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Travel Care:</strong> If possible, avoid flying. If you must travel, chew gum during
                        takeoff and
                        landing.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>When to Visit Maria Hospital</h2>
                <p>Don't ignore ear problems. Complications like chronic infection or permanent hearing loss can occur
                    if left
                    untreated. Please book a <strong>doctor consultation</strong> immediately if:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You have sudden hearing loss or severe pain.</li>
                    <li>You see pus or blood coming from your ear.</li>
                    <li>You feel very dizzy or off-balance.</li>
