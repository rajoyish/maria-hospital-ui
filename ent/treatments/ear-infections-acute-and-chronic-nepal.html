                    Ear infections can cause sharp pain, pressure, and discomfort that affect daily activities and
                    concentration. Early
                    medical evaluation helps identify the cause, relieve pain, and prevent complications such as hearing
                    problems.

                <h2>What Is an Ear Infection?</h2>
                <p>An ear infection (medically called <em>otitis media</em>) happens when germs—like a virus or
                    bacteria—get
                    trapped in the air-filled space behind the eardrum. This is called the middle ear.</p>
                <p>When this area gets infected, it swells and fills with fluid. This pressure causes pain and can
                    affect
                    hearing. While this is one of the most common reasons parents book a <strong>health checkup</strong>
                    for
                    their children, it can happen to adults too.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Types of Ear Infections: Short-term vs. Long-term</h2>
                <p>Doctors usually divide ear infections into two categories:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Acute Ear Infections:</strong> These start quickly and are often very painful. Most
                        clear up
                        within a few days, but the pain requires attention.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chronic Ear Infections:</strong> These last a long time (over three months) or keep
                        coming back.
                        While less painful, they can be dangerous because they may cause permanent hearing damage if
                        left
                        untreated.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <figure>
                <img class="h-auto w-full rounded-xl"
                    src="/images/treatments/ear-infections/healthy-and-infected-ear.avif" width="1200" height="630"
                    alt="Medical illustration comparing a healthy ear and an infected ear, showing fluid buildup, redness and swelling in the middle ear, and a blocked Eustachian tube that causes pressure and pain." />
                <figcaption>
                    An ear infection occurs when the Eustachian tube becomes blocked, allowing fluid to build up behind
                    the eardrum. This
                    leads to swelling, redness, pain, and sometimes hearing difficulty. Early treatment helps relieve
                    symptoms and prevents
                    long‑term ear problems.

            </figure>

            <section>
                <h2>Why Do They Happen?</h2>
                <p>Your ear is connected to your throat by a small channel called the Eustachian tube. This tube drains
                    fluid
                    and keeps air flowing. If it gets blocked, fluid builds up and gets infected.</p>
                <p>Common triggers in Nepal include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Common colds, the flu, or sinus infections.</li>
                    <li>Allergies caused by dust, pollen, or pollution in the Kathmandu valley.</li>
                    <li>Exposure to cigarette smoke.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Why Are Children More at Risk?</h2>
                <p>You may notice that children get sick with ear infections much more often than adults. This is
                    because their
                    Eustachian tubes are smaller and lay more flat, making it harder for fluid to drain. Also,
                    children’s immune
                    systems are still learning how to fight off germs.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Signs and Symptoms to Watch For</h2>
                <p>Symptoms look different depending on age. If you notice these signs, it may be time for a
                    <strong>diagnosis</strong> at Maria Hospital.
                </p>

                <h3>In Babies and Young Children:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Crying more than usual and acting irritable.</li>
                    <li>Pulling, tugging, or rubbing the ear.</li>
                    <li>High fever (100.5°F to 104°F).</li>
                    <li>Refusing to eat or trouble sleeping.</li>
                    <li>Fluid draining from the ear.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>In Older Children and Adults:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sharp ear pain or a dull ache.</li>
                    <li>A feeling of "fullness" or pressure in the ear.</li>
                    <li>Muffled hearing (like you are underwater).</li>
                    <li>Nausea or dizziness.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>How We Diagnose and Treat Ear Infections</h2>
                <p>When you visit us for a <strong>doctor consultation</strong>, our specialists use a lighted tool
                    called an
                    otoscope to look inside the ear. We check for redness, fluid, or pressure behind the eardrum.</p>

                <h3>Treatment Options</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Home Care:</strong> Many infections heal on their own. We may suggest warm compresses,
                        rest, and
                        pain relievers like acetaminophen (Paracetamol) or ibuprofen.</li>
                    <li><strong>Antibiotics:</strong> These are only used if the infection is caused by bacteria.
                        Antibiotics do
                        not work on viruses. A doctor must decide if they are necessary.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ear Tubes (Surgery):</strong> For children with chronic infections that affect hearing,
                        a small
                        procedure to place tubes in the ear can help drain fluid.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Prevention Tips for Healthy Ears</h2>
                <p>You can lower the risk of infection for your family with these simple habits:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Vaccinate:</strong> Keep children up to date on flu and other vaccines.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hygiene:</strong> Wash hands often to stop the spread of colds.</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid Smoke:</strong> Keep your home smoke-free.</li>
                    <li><strong>Breastfeeding:</strong> Breast milk contains antibodies that fight infection.</li>
                    <li><strong>Feeding Position:</strong> If bottle-feeding, hold the baby upright so milk doesn't flow
                        back
                        into the ear tubes.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>When to Visit Maria Hospital</h2>
                <p>While some earaches pass, others need professional medical attention to prevent complications like
                    hearing
                    loss. Please visit Maria Hospital in Kathmandu immediately if:</p>
                <ul>
