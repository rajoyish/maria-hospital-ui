            <p class="lead">Ear pain is one of the most common reasons people seek a doctor
                consultation in
                Kathmandu. Whether it is a sharp, sudden ache or a dull, throbbing feeling, ear pain
                can be distressing.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">While most earaches are not dangerous, they can be very painful and may signal an infection
                that requires
                attention. At Maria Hospital, we want to help you understand why your ear hurts and how
                to get
                the right diagnosis and treatment.</p>

                    Ear pain can range from a dull ache to sharp discomfort and may be caused by ear infections,
                    pressure changes, earwax
                    buildup, or problems in the jaw or throat. If ear pain persists or is severe, a medical checkup
                    helps identify the cause
                    and provide proper relief.

            <section>
                <h2>What Are the Symptoms?</h2>
                <p>Ear pain can affect just one ear or both. The feeling can change depending on your age and the cause.
                </p>

                <h3>Symptoms in Adults:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dull, sharp, or burning pain.</li>
                    <li>A feeling of pressure or "blockage" inside the ear.</li>
                    <li>Pain in the jaw or difficulty chewing food.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Symptoms in Babies and Children:</h3>
                <p>Young children often cannot explain what is wrong. If you are a parent in <strong>Nepal</strong>,
                    look for
                    these signs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pulling, tugging, or rubbing the ear.</li>
                    <li>Crying more than usual or acting fussy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fever</strong> (high temperature).</li>
                    <li>Refusing to eat or difficulty sleeping.</li>
                    <li>Not reacting to sounds or losing balance.</li>
                </ul>

                    Ear pain (earache) can originate from different parts of the ear, including the ear canal, middle
                    ear, or Eustachian
                    tube. Treatment depends on the cause and may include pain relievers, warm or cold compresses, ear
                    drops, and avoiding
                    inserting objects into the ear.

                <h2>Why Does My Ear Hurt?</h2>
                <p>To provide the best <strong>health checkup</strong>, doctors divide ear pain into two categories:
                    problems
                    inside the ear and problems coming from other parts of the body.</p>

                <h3>1. Problems Inside the Ear</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ear Infections:</strong> This is very common in children. It can happen in the middle
                        ear or the
                        ear canal (often after swimming).</li>
                    <li><strong>Earwax Buildup:</strong> Hardened wax can block the ear canal and cause pressure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pressure Changes:</strong> Travel, such as flying or driving up into the hills around
                        <strong>Kathmandu</strong>, can cause pain due to air pressure changes.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Injury:</strong> Scratching the inside of the ear with a finger or cotton bud.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Pain From Other Areas (Referred Pain)</h3>
                <p>Sometimes, your ear is healthy, but you feel pain because the ear shares nerves with your throat and
                    jaw.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dental Issues:</strong> Toothaches or cavities often send pain signals to the ear.</li>
                    <li><strong>Jaw Problems:</strong> Grinding your teeth or jaw joint issues (TMJ).</li>
                    <li><strong>Throat Infections:</strong> Tonsillitis or a bad cold can make your ears hurt.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>How Can I Treat Ear Pain at Home?</h2>
                <p>If the pain is mild, you can try these home remedies before your <strong>doctor
                        consultation</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Warm or Cold Compress:</strong> Hold a warm cloth or a cold pack against the outside of
                        the ear
                        for 20 minutes to soothe the pain.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rest Upright:</strong> Sleep with your head on two pillows to help drain fluid and lower
                        pressure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pain Relief:</strong> Common over-the-counter medicines like Paracetamol or Ibuprofen
                        can help
                        reduce pain and fever. <em>(Note: Never give aspirin to children)</em>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do Not Insert Anything:</strong> Never put oil, cotton swabs, or sharp objects inside
                        the ear
                        unless a doctor tells you to.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Medical Diagnosis and Treatment</h2>
                <p>If home remedies don't work, you need a professional <strong>diagnosis</strong>. When you visit
                    <strong>Maria
                        Hospital</strong>, our doctors will gently check inside your ear using a special light.
                </p>
                <p>Treatment options may include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Antibiotics:</strong> Prescribed only if a bacterial infection is found.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ear Drops:</strong> To relieve pain or treat inflammation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Professional Wax Removal:</strong> Our staff can safely remove blocked wax.</li>
                </ul>

            <section>
                <h2>When Should I Visit Maria Hospital?</h2>
                <p>While some earaches go away on their own, you should not take risks with your hearing. Please book a
                    <strong>health checkup</strong> at <strong>Maria Hospital</strong> if:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The pain lasts longer than 3 days.</li>
                    <li>You have a high fever (103°F / 39.4°C or higher).</li>
                    <li>There is fluid, pus, or blood coming out of the ear.</li>
                    <li>You see swelling or redness behind the ear.</li>
                    <li>You have sudden hearing loss or dizziness.</li>
                    <li>You have diabetes or a weak immune system.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Simple Prevention Tips</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Don't Poke Your Ears:</strong> Avoid using cotton buds (Q-tips) inside the ear canal.
                        They push
                        wax deeper.</li>
                    <li><strong>Keep Ears Dry:</strong> Dry your ears well after bathing or swimming.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stay Healthy:</strong> Managing allergies and avoiding cigarette smoke can reduce the
                        risk of
                        ear infections.</li>
                </ul>
