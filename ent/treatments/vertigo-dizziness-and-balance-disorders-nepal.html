            <section>
                <p class="lead">A balance disorder is a condition that makes you feel unsteady or dizzy. This can happen
                    whether you
                    are
                    lying in bed, sitting in a chair, or walking down the street. Doctors usually group these feelings
                    into
                    three main types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Vertigo:</strong> A specific feeling that you—or the room around you—is spinning, even
                        when
                        you
                        are standing still.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dizziness:</strong> A general feeling of being lightheaded, woozy, or faint.</li>
                    <li><strong>Imbalance:</strong> A feeling of unsteadiness, like you might fall over while walking.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                    Vertigo and balance disorders can cause a spinning sensation, unsteadiness, and fear of falling.
                    These symptoms often
                    start in the inner ear, and with proper diagnosis and treatment, most people can regain balance and
                    confidence in daily
                    activities.

            <section>
                <h2>How Your Body Keeps Balance</h2>
                <p>Your brain acts like a control center. To keep you steady, it collects information from three main
                    areas:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Your Eyes:</strong> They tell you where you are.</li>
                    <li><strong>Your Muscles & Joints:</strong> They tell your brain if you are moving or standing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Your Inner Ear:</strong> This is the most important part. It detects gravity and head
                        movements.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>When these signals don't match (for example, your inner ear thinks you are spinning, but your eyes
                    say
                    you
                    are sitting still), you experience vertigo.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Common Symptoms</h2>
                <p>Aside from the "spinning" sensation, you might also experience:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nausea or vomiting.</li>
                    <li>Blurred vision.</li>
                    <li>Stumbling or trouble walking straight.</li>
                    <li>Confusion or anxiety.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                <figcaption>
                    BPPV occurs when tiny calcium crystals (otoconia) move into the wrong part of the inner ear’s
                    semicircular canals. This
                    disrupts balance signals sent to the brain and causes brief episodes of spinning vertigo, especially
                    with head
                    movements. Proper repositioning maneuvers can effectively treat this condition.

                <h2>Top Causes of Balance Problems</h2>
                <p>Most balance issues start in the inner ear. Here are the most common causes our doctors see:</p>

                <article>
                    <h3>1. BPPV (The "Ear Crystal" Problem)</h3>
                    <p>This is the most common cause of vertigo in adults. It happens when tiny calcium crystals inside
                        your
                        ear
                        break loose and move to the wrong place.</p>
                    <p><strong>What it feels like:</strong> Short, intense spinning when you move your head (like
                        rolling
                        over
                        in bed or looking up).</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>2. Viral Infections (Labyrinthitis)</h3>
                    <p>Sometimes, a simple virus (like the flu) can cause inflammation in your inner ear.</p>
                    <p><strong>What it feels like:</strong> Sudden, severe dizziness that can last for days, often with
                        nausea.
                    </p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>3. Meniere’s Disease</h3>
                    <p>A chronic condition caused by fluid buildup in the inner ear.</p>
                    <p><strong>What it feels like:</strong> Long episodes of vertigo (20 minutes or more), ringing in
                        the
                        ears
                        (tinnitus), and hearing changes.</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>4. Migraines</h3>
                    <p>Migraines are not just headaches; they can cause dizziness too.</p>
                    <p><strong>What it feels like:</strong> Dizziness triggered by light, sound, or motion, sometimes
                        without
                        any head pain.</p>
                </article>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Diagnosis at Maria Hospital</h2>
                <p>Finding the root cause of your dizziness is the first step toward relief. When you visit
                    <strong>Maria
                        Hospital</strong> for a doctor consultation, our specialists (ENTs or audiologists) may use:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hearing Tests:</strong> To check the connection between your hearing and balance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Balance Tests:</strong> Using special goggles or platforms to see how your inner ear
                        reacts
                        to
                        movement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Position Tests:</strong> A doctor may carefully move your head to see if it triggers
                        vertigo
                        (confirming BPPV).</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Treatment Options in Nepal</h2>
                <p>The good news is that most balance disorders are highly treatable. Depending on your diagnosis, your
                    treatment plan may include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Repositioning Maneuvers:</strong> A doctor guides your head through specific movements
                        to
                        move
                        ear crystals back to the right place.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vestibular Rehabilitation:</strong> Specialized exercises to retrain your brain and
                        improve
                        stability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Medication:</strong> To control nausea or manage conditions like migraines.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lifestyle Changes:</strong> Simple adjustments like staying hydrated or reducing salt.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>When to Seek Emergency Care</h2>
                <p>While most vertigo is not dangerous, it can sometimes signal a serious issue like a stroke. Please
                    visit
                    the
                    hospital immediately if your dizziness comes with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A sudden, severe headache.</li>
                    <li>Chest pain.</li>
                    <li>Double vision.</li>
