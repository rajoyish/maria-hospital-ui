                <p class="lead">Hearing loss is a very common condition. While it can affect anyone, it is most often
                    linked to getting older. If you or a family member are finding it harder to hear, you are not alone.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">At Maria Hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal, we believe that understanding why your hearing is
                    changing is the first step to feeling better. With the right diagnosis and care, you can improve
                    your communication and enjoy a better quality of life.</p>

                    Age‑related hearing loss often makes it difficult to understand speech, especially in conversations
                    or noisy environments. Early hearing evaluation and proper treatment can greatly improve
                    communication and quality of life for older adults.

                <h2>What Is Age-Related Hearing Loss?</h2>
                <p>As we age, our bodies change, and that includes our ears. Medically, this is called
                    <em>presbycusis</em>. It is a gradual loss of hearing that happens slowly over time.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>It is common:</strong> About one in three adults over the age of 65 has some hearing
                        loss.</li>
                    <li><strong>It is slow:</strong> Because it happens gradually, you might not notice it immediately.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>It affects both ears:</strong> Usually, hearing fades in both ears at the same time.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Common Symptoms: Is This Happening to You?</h2>
                <p>Often, family members notice the problem before the patient does. You might need a <strong>health
                        checkup</strong> if you experience these signs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Conversation struggles:</strong> It is hard to understand people, especially in noisy
                        places like restaurants or family gatherings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Volume issues:</strong> You turn the TV, radio, or mobile phone volume much higher than
                        others do.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mumbling voices:</strong> It feels like people are mumbling or not speaking clearly.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Missing sounds:</strong> You cannot hear high-pitched sounds, like birds chirping or the
                        voices of women and children.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ringing ears:</strong> You hear a ringing or buzzing sound (tinnitus) in your ears.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repeating words:</strong> You frequently have to ask people to repeat words.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Why Does Hearing Loss Happen?</h2>
                <p>Hearing loss occurs when parts of the ear are damaged or blocked. The two main types are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Permanent Hearing Loss (Sensorineural):</strong> This is usually caused by aging or
                        damage to the inner ear nerves.</li>
                    <li><strong>Blockage (Conductive):</strong> This happens when sound cannot get through due to
                        earwax, fluid, or infection. This can often be fixed with simple <strong>treatment</strong>.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Key Risk Factors</h3>
                <p>Aside from aging, other things can affect your hearing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Loud Noise:</strong> Long-term exposure to Kathmandu traffic, construction noise, or
                        loud music.</li>
                    <li><strong>Health Conditions:</strong> Diabetes and high blood pressure are linked to hearing
                        issues.</li>
                    <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> Sometimes, hearing loss runs in the family.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
