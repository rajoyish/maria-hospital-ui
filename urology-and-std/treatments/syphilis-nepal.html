                    Syphilis is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by bacteria. It is often called
                    the <em>"great imitator"</em> because its symptoms can look like many other illnesses.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    If you are worried about symptoms, take a deep breath. The most important thing to know is that
                    <strong>syphilis is completely curable</strong> with the right medication. At Maria Hospital,
                    located centrally in Kathmandu in Nepal, we provide confidential doctor consultation and
                    effective treatment to help you get back to full health.

                    Syphilis spreads through direct sexual contact and may not cause obvious symptoms at first.
                    Regular testing, early diagnosis, and timely treatment are essential to protect your health and
                    prevent serious long‑term complications.

                <h2>How Do You Get Syphilis?</h2>
                <p>
                    Syphilis is spread through direct contact with a syphilis sore during sex (vaginal, anal, or
                    oral). These sores can appear on the genitals, rectum, or lips and mouth.
                </p>
                <p>It is important to know that you <strong>CANNOT</strong> get syphilis from:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Toilet seats or doorknobs</li>
                    <li>Swimming pools or hot tubs</li>
                    <li>Sharing clothes or eating utensils</li>

                <figcaption>
                    A painless sore on the genitals is often the first sign of syphilis. Because it heals without
                    treatment, many people ignore it, allowing the infection to progress. Early testing and
                    antibiotic treatment can completely cure syphilis and prevent serious complications.

                <h2>The 4 Stages of Syphilis</h2>
                <p>
                    Syphilis happens in stages. You might have the infection for years without knowing it, which is
                    why a regular <strong>health checkup</strong> is so important.
                </p>
                <div class="stage">
                    <h3>1. Primary Stage (The First Sign)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>What happens:</strong> A small sore (called a chancre) appears where the
                            bacteria entered your body.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>What it looks like:</strong> The sore is usually round, firm, and painless.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Timing:</strong> It appears about 3 weeks after exposure.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Healing:</strong> It heals on its own in 3 to 6 weeks,
                            <em>but the infection is still inside you.</em> You need treatment to stop it from
                            getting worse.
                        </li>

                            the bottoms of your feet. It usually does not itch.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Flu-like Symptoms:</strong> You might feel tired, have a fever, sore throat,
                            swollen glands, or muscle aches.
                        </li>

                            medicine, but the infection remains dangerous.

                    Syphilis develops in stages. In the first stage, a painless sore appears at the site of
                    infection and may heal on its own. In the second stage, a non‑itchy rash—often on the palms or
                    soles—can develop. Even if symptoms disappear, treatment is essential to fully cure the
                    infection.

                    If left untreated, syphilis can spread to the brain (Neurosyphilis), eyes (Ocular Syphilis), or
                    ears.

                <h3>For Pregnant Women:</h3>
                <p>
                    Syphilis is dangerous for unborn babies. It can cause miscarriage or serious health issues for
                    the baby after birth.

                <p>
                    The only way to know for sure if you have syphilis is to get tested. At Maria Hospital, we use
                    simple and quick methods:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Blood Tests:</strong> To check for antibodies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fluid Testing:</strong> Checking fluid from a sore.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    You should book a <strong>doctor consultation</strong> if you have symptoms, if your partner has
                    tested positive, or if you simply want peace of mind.

                <h2>Treatment: Simple and Effective</h2>
                <p>Syphilis is curable.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Antibiotics:</strong> The standard <strong>treatment</strong> is Penicillin.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Early Stages:</strong> Usually, a single injection is enough to cure the infection.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Later Stages:</strong> You may need additional doses.</li>

                    <strong>Note:</strong> Treatment cures the infection and stops future damage, but it cannot
                    repair permanent damage already done to your organs.
                    <strong>This is why early testing is vital.</strong>
