                    Are you having trouble in the bedroom? You are not alone.
                    <strong>Erectile Dysfunction (ED)</strong>, commonly known as
                    impotence, is the most common sexual health issue men face. However,
                    due to embarrassment, many suffer in silence rather than seeking a
                    doctor consultation.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    At Maria Hospital, located in the heart of Kathmandu in Nepal, we
                    believe that sexual health is a vital part of your overall
                    well-being. This guide will help you understand ED, its causes, and
                    how proper diagnosis and treatment can help you get your confidence

                    Erectile dysfunction can affect both physical intimacy and emotional
                    well-being. Feelings of stress, worry, and reduced confidence are
                    common, but with proper diagnosis and treatment, ED is a manageable
                    condition and couples can regain closeness and confidence.

                <h2>What is Erectile Dysfunction?</h2>
                <p>
                    Simply put, Erectile Dysfunction is the inability to get or keep an
                    erection firm enough for sexual intercourse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While it is normal to have occasional trouble due to stress or
                    tiredness, ED is considered a medical condition when:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It happens routinely.</li>
                    <li>It progressively gets worse over time.</li>
                </ul>

                    <p class="bg-emerald-500/10 border-emerald-500 border-l-4 p-3">
                        <strong>Did you know?</strong> Although ED is more common in older
                        men (affecting over 50% of men aged 40–70), it is <em>not</em>
                        just a natural part of aging. It is a treatable condition.

                <p>
                    If you are worried about your sexual health, look out for these
                    common signs:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Difficulty getting an erection before sex.</li>
                    <li>Trouble keeping an erection during sexual activity.</li>
                    <li>Reduced sexual desire (low libido).</li>

                <figcaption>
                    An erection occurs when blood flows into the corpus cavernosum,
                    causing the penis to expand and become firm. In erectile
                    dysfunction, this normal blood‑flow process is reduced or
                    interrupted, leading to difficulty achieving or maintaining an
                    erection.

                <h2>What Causes ED?</h2>
                <p>
                    It is rarely <em>"just in your head."</em> In fact, ED is often the
                    body’s way of warning you about other underlying health problems.
                </p>

                <h3>1. Physical Health Issues</h3>
                <p>
                    An erection requires healthy blood flow. Therefore, conditions that
                    block or damage your blood vessels are the most common causes.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Heart Health:</strong> High blood pressure and clogged
                        arteries are major triggers. ED can sometimes be an early warning
                        sign of heart disease.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Diabetes:</strong> This is very common in Nepal. Men with
                        diabetes are at high risk because high blood sugar damages nerves
                        and blood vessels.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Smoking, heavy alcohol use, obesity,
                        and lack of exercise can all lead to ED.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Medications:</strong> Some medicines for blood pressure or
                        depression may affect your ability to get an erection.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Psychological Factors</h3>
                <p>
                    Your brain plays a big role in intimacy. Emotional triggers include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Stress and anxiety (especially fear of "performing" well).
                    </li>
                    <li>Depression.</li>
                    <li>Relationship conflicts.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Diagnosis: What to Expect at Maria Hospital</h2>
                <p>
                    Many men avoid the doctor because they feel shy, but a proper
                    <strong>health checkup</strong> is the first step toward a cure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you visit <strong>Maria Hospital</strong> for a doctor
                    consultation, we ensure a private, professional, and comfortable
                    environment. Your diagnosis may include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Medical History:</strong> A chat about your health,
                        lifestyle, and history.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Physical Exam:</strong> Checking your blood pressure and
                        physical health to assess blood flow.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Lab Tests:</strong> Simple blood tests to check for
                        diabetes, cholesterol, and testosterone levels.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Mental Well-being:</strong> Discussing any stress or
                        anxiety you might be feeling.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p class="bg-warning/10 border-warning border-l-4 p-3">
                    <strong>Note:</strong> Many men suffering from conditions like high
                    blood pressure actually have ED but don't realize it is connected. A
                    checkup can solve both issues.

                <h2>Effective Treatment Options</h2>
                <p>
                    The good news is that ED is highly treatable. We use a "stepwise"
                    approach, starting with the simplest solutions.
                </p>

                <h3>1. Lifestyle Changes</h3>
                <p>
                    Better general health leads to better sexual health. We may
                    recommend:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Quitting smoking.</li>
                    <li>Losing weight through diet.</li>
                    <li>
                        Increasing exercise (which improves blood flow and vascular
                        health).
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Oral Medications</h3>
                <p>
                    This is the most common treatment. Drugs like sildenafil (Viagra®)
                    and tadalafil (Cialis®) help relax muscles to increase blood flow
                    during stimulation.
                </p>
                <p class="bg-warning/10 border-warning border-l-4 p-3">
                    <strong>Important Safety Warning:</strong> Never take these pills
                    without a prescription, especially if you take nitrate medication
                    for chest pain. Always consult a doctor first.
                </p>
