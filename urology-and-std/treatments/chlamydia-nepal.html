                    Chlamydia is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections
                    (STIs). It is caused by bacteria and is fully curable with the right
                    medication. However, it is often called a
                    <strong>"silent" infection</strong> because many people do not show
                    any obvious signs.
                </p>

                <p class="lead">
                    If you live in Kathmandu in Nepal and are concerned about your
                    sexual health, it is important to understand the risks. Because
                    symptoms are rare, you might have it without knowing, potentially
                    passing it to others or facing long-term health issues.

                    Here is everything you need to know about symptoms, risks, and how
                    Maria Hospital can help you with confidential testing and treatment.

                    Chlamydia is often a “silent” infection that can cause stress and
                    uncertainty for couples. Confidential testing, early diagnosis, and
                    proper treatment help prevent long‑term complications and protect
                    both partners’ health.

                <h2>How Does Chlamydia Spread?</h2>
                <p>
                    Chlamydia is transmitted through sexual contact. You can catch it by
                    having vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone who has the
                    infection.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Fluids:</strong> It spreads through vaginal fluid and
                        semen.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>No Ejaculation Needed:</strong> A man does not need to
                        ejaculate (cum) to pass the infection to his partner.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Mother to Baby:</strong> A pregnant woman can pass the
                        infection to her baby during childbirth.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Myth Buster:</strong> You <strong>cannot</strong> get
                        chlamydia from casual contact like hugging, holding hands, sharing
                        food, or sitting on a toilet seat.

                <h2>Signs and Symptoms to Watch For</h2>
                <p>
                    Most people (50% to 90%) have no symptoms at all. If symptoms do
                    appear, they may take several weeks to show up after sex with an
                    infected partner. If you notice any of these, you should schedule a
                    <strong>doctor consultation</strong> immediately.
                </p>

                <h3>Symptoms in Women</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Abnormal vaginal discharge (often with a strong smell).</li>
                    <li>A burning sensation when urinating (peeing).</li>
                    <li>Bleeding between periods or after sex.</li>
                    <li>Pain during sex or lower abdominal pain.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Symptoms in Men</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Watery, white, or milky discharge from the penis.</li>
                    <li>A burning sensation when urinating.</li>
                    <li>Pain or swelling in the testicles (less common).</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="bg-warning/10 border-warning border-l-4 p-3">
                    <strong>Note:</strong> Infections in the rectum or throat usually
                    have no symptoms but can sometimes cause pain, discharge, or a sore
                    throat.

                <h2>Why Is Treatment So Important?</h2>
                <p>
                    Even if you feel fine, leaving Chlamydia untreated can cause
                    permanent damage to your body. Early <strong>diagnosis</strong> is
                    key to preventing these complications:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Infertility in Women:</strong> Untreated chlamydia can
                        spread to the uterus and fallopian tubes. This causes Pelvic
                        Inflammatory Disease (PID), which can lead to scarring and make it
                        difficult or impossible to get pregnant later.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Pregnancy Risks:</strong> It increases the risk of ectopic
                        pregnancy (a life-threatening pregnancy outside the womb).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Joint Pain:</strong> In some people, it triggers reactive
                        arthritis, causing joint pain and swelling.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>HIV Risk:</strong> It can increase your chances of getting
                        or transmitting HIV.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Pregnancy and Chlamydia</h3>
                <p>
                    If you are pregnant, getting a <strong>health checkup</strong> is
                    vital. Chlamydia can lead to premature birth. If passed to the baby
                    during delivery, the infant may suffer from serious eye infections
                    or pneumonia.

            <section>
                <h2>How Is It Diagnosed and Treated?</h2>
                <p>
                    The good news is that testing is simple, painless, and confidential
                    at <strong>Maria Hospital</strong>.
                </p>

                <h3>Simple Testing</h3>
                <p>
                    You don't need complex procedures. A doctor usually performs a
                    <strong>diagnosis</strong> using:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Urine Test:</strong> You simply pee in a cup.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Swab Test:</strong> A quick swab from the infected area
                        (vagina, throat, etc.).
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Effective Treatment</h3>
                <p>
                    Chlamydia is curable. Your doctor will prescribe antibiotics
                    (usually taken for 7 days or as a single dose).
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Take all medicine:</strong> Finish the full course, even
                        if symptoms stop.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Treat your partner:</strong> Your sexual partner(s) from
                        the last 60 days must also get <strong>treatment</strong> to stop
                        you from getting infected again.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Wait to have sex:</strong> Avoid sex until treatment is
                        complete and symptoms are gone.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Prevention: Protect Yourself</h2>
                <p>
                    The only 100% way to avoid Chlamydia is not to have sex. However, if
                    you are sexually active, you can lower your risk by:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Using Condoms:</strong> Use latex condoms correctly every
                        time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Monogamy:</strong> Being in a relationship where both
                        partners have been tested.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Regular Screening:</strong> Routine checkups help catch
                        infections early.
                    </li>
