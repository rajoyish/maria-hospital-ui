                Do you feel like you "finish" too quickly during intimacy? If so,

            <p class="lead">
                Premature Ejaculation (PE) is a medical condition where a man
                ejaculates sooner than he or his partner wants. It is actually the
                most common sexual health issue for men, affecting nearly 40% of the
                male population at some point.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
                At Maria Hospital, located in the heart of Kathmandu in Nepal, we know
                that this condition can cause stress, embarrassment, and relationship
                trouble. But we also know the most important fact:
                <strong>PE is treatable, and it is not a permanent flaw.</strong>
            </p>

                    Premature ejaculation can cause anxiety, frustration, and emotional
                    strain for both partners. With understanding, open communication,
                    and proper treatment, this common condition can be effectively
                    managed and intimacy can improve.

                <h2>What Exactly is Premature Ejaculation?</h2>
                <p>
                    While it is normal to finish early occasionally, doctors generally
                    consider it a medical condition if three things happen:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Timing:</strong> Ejaculation happens within one minute (or
                        less) of starting intercourse.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>No Control:</strong> You feel like you cannot delay or
                        stop it from happening.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Distress:</strong> It causes you frustration, anxiety, or
                        makes you avoid intimacy with your partner.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Why Does It Happen?</h2>
                <p>
                    The causes of PE are often a mix of your physical health and your
                    mindset. It is rarely just "one thing."
                </p>

                <h3>Psychological Factors</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Anxiety:</strong> Nervousness about performance or being
                        with a new partner.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Relationship Stress:</strong> Unresolved conflicts or lack
                        of communication.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Depression:</strong> Low mood or guilt can affect sexual
                        performance.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Physical Factors</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Serotonin Levels:</strong> Chemical imbalances in the
                        brain can speed up ejaculation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Prostate Health:</strong> Infection or inflammation in the
                        prostate.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Erectile Issues:</strong> Men worried about losing an
                        erection might rush, creating a habit of finishing fast.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    This diagram shows how the prostate, nerves, blood vessels, and
                    reproductive organs work together during ejaculation. Conditions
                    affecting prostate health, nerve signals, or blood flow can
                    contribute to sexual concerns such as premature ejaculation,
                    highlighting the importance of proper diagnosis and treatment.

                <h2>Diagnosis: A Simple Health Checkup</h2>
                <p>
                    Many men fear that a <strong>diagnosis</strong> requires painful
                    tests. At Maria Hospital, this is not the case.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our <strong>doctor consultation</strong> is private, confidential,
                    and comfortable. Your doctor will simply ask about your medical
                    history and sexual life, such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How long have you faced this issue?</li>
                    <li>Does it happen with every partner?</li>
                    <li>Do you also have trouble keeping an erection?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This conversation helps us understand the root cause so we can
                    create the right plan for you.

                <h2>Effective Treatment Options</h2>
                <p>
                    The good news is that most men see great improvement with the right
                    help. <strong>Treatment</strong> usually combines simple techniques,
                    medication, or counseling.
                </p>

                <h3>1. Behavioral Techniques</h3>
                <p>These are methods to help you "unlearn" the habit of rushing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>The Stop-Start Method:</strong> Stimulation is stopped
                        just before you feel you are about to finish, allowing the feeling
                        to pass before starting again. [Image of stop-start technique for
                        premature ejaculation]
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>The Squeeze Method:</strong> Gently squeezing the head of
                        the penis to reduce the urge to ejaculate. [Image of squeeze
                        technique for premature ejaculation]
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Pelvic Floor Exercises:</strong> Strengthening the muscles
                        used to stop urination (Kegels) can give you better control.

                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Medications</h3>
                <p>
                    Your doctor at Maria Hospital may prescribe safe medications to
                    help:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Oral Medication:</strong> Certain medicines can boost
                        serotonin levels to delay ejaculation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Numbing Creams/Sprays:</strong> These reduce sensitivity
                        slightly to help you last longer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>ED Treatment:</strong> If you also have
                        <a href="/erectile-dysfunction-ed-and-impotent-nepal">Erectile Dysfunction</a>, treating that
                        often solves the PE issue too.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Counseling</h3>
                <p>
                    Since anxiety is a big factor, speaking to a specialist can help
                    build your confidence and reduce performance pressure.
