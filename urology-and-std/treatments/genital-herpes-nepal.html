                <h2>What is Genital Herpes?</h2>
                <p>Genital herpes is an infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). It typically affects the
                    genital area, causing sores or blisters. There are two main types of the virus:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>HSV-1:</strong> Usually causes cold sores on the lips but can spread to the genitals
                        during oral sex.</li>
                    <li><strong>HSV-2:</strong> The most common cause of genital herpes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Once the virus enters your body, it stays there for life. However, this does not mean you will always
                    be sick. The virus often "sleeps" in your body, and many people live healthy, normal lives with it.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>How Does it Spread?</h2>
                <p>The virus spreads through skin-to-skin contact during vaginal, anal, or oral sex. It is important to
                    know that you can get herpes even if your partner has no visible sores.</p>

                <h3>You can catch the virus through:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contact with open sores or blisters.</li>
                    <li>Saliva, semen, or vaginal fluids.</li>
                    <li><strong>Asymptomatic Shedding:</strong> When the virus is active on the skin but there are no
                        visible signs.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>You CANNOT get herpes from:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Toilet seats (western or squat).</li>
                    <li>Swimming pools.</li>
                    <li>Sharing towels, cups, or plates.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                    Genital herpes often appears as small blisters that break open into painful ulcers. Early diagnosis
                    and antiviral treatment help reduce pain and shorten outbreaks.

                <h2>Common Symptoms to Watch For</h2>
                <p>Many people in Nepal have this virus without knowing it because they have no symptoms. However, if
                    symptoms do appear, they usually happen in stages.</p>

                <h3>The First Outbreak</h3>
                <p>This is usually the most painful and can last 2 to 4 weeks. Look out for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Small, fluid-filled blisters on the genitals or bottom.</li>
                    <li>Painful open sores that eventually scab over.</li>
                    <li>Pain or burning when urinating (peeing).</li>
                    <li>Flu-like feelings (fever, body aches, or swollen glands).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Repeat Outbreaks</h3>
                <p>After the first time, the virus may "wake up" again later. These outbreaks are usually shorter and
                    less painful. You might feel a tingling or itching sensation (a warning sign) before sores appear.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Common Triggers:</strong> Stress, illness, tight clothing, or menstruation can sometimes
                    trigger an outbreak.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Diagnosis and Testing</h2>
                <p>If you suspect you have herpes, it is vital to see a professional for a <strong>diagnosis</strong>.
                    At Maria Hospital, we offer discreet testing.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Swab Test:</strong> If you have active sores, a doctor will gently take a sample to test
                        for the virus. This is the most accurate method.</li>
                    <li><strong>Blood Test:</strong> If no sores are present, a blood test can check for antibodies.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Do not guess your health status. A proper <strong>health checkup</strong> is the only way to be sure.
                </p>

                <figcaption>
                    During an outbreak, antiviral medication, soothing care like ice packs, loose clothing, and avoiding
                    contact with sores can help reduce discomfort and speed healing.

                <h2>Treatment and Management</h2>
                <p>While there is currently no cure for herpes, modern medicine makes it very easy to manage. A
                    <strong>doctor consultation</strong> will help determine the best plan for you.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Antiviral Medicines:</strong> Drugs like acyclovir can shorten outbreaks or prevent them
                        from happening.</li>
                    <li><strong>Daily Management:</strong> Some people take medicine every day (suppressive therapy) to
                        lower the risk of passing the virus to a partner.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Simple Home Remedies</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep the area clean with salt water.</li>
                    <li>Wear loose, cotton clothing to allow the skin to breathe.</li>
                    <li>Use an ice pack (wrapped in a cloth) to soothe pain.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Pregnancy and Family Planning</h2>
                <p>If you are pregnant or planning a baby, please tell your doctor if you or your partner have herpes.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Safety First:</strong> If you have an active outbreak during labor, there is a risk to
                        the baby.</li>
                    <li><strong>Medical Support:</strong> Doctors in <strong>Kathmandu, Nepal</strong> can prescribe
                        medication late in pregnancy to prevent outbreaks, or recommend a C-section to protect your
                        newborn.</li>

                <h2>Living a Healthy Life</h2>
                <p>A diagnosis of genital herpes does not mean your romantic life is over.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Use Condoms:</strong> They reduce the risk of spreading the virus (though they don't
                        eliminate it 100%).</li>
                    <li><strong>Communicate:</strong> Be honest with your partner.</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid Sex During Outbreaks:</strong> Wait until sores have completely healed.</li>
