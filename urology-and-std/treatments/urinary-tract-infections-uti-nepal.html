                <h2>What is a UTI?</h2>
                <p>A UTI is an infection that happens in any part of your urinary system. This system includes:</p>

                <dl>
                    <dt>Kidneys</dt>
                    <dd>Filters waste from your blood.</dd>

                    <dt>Ureters</dt>
                    <dd>Tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder.</dd>

                    <dt>Bladder</dt>
                    <dd>The organ that stores your urine.</dd>

                    <dt>Urethra</dt>
                    <dd>The tube that carries urine out of your body.</dd>
                </dl>

                <p>While an infection can happen anywhere in this system, it most often occurs in the lower part: the
                    bladder and the urethra.</p>
            </section>

                    <li><strong>Frequent Urge:</strong> Feeling a strong need to pee often, even if only a small amount

                </ul>

                    <h3>⚠️ Important Warning: Kidney Infection</h3>
                    <p>If the infection spreads to your kidneys, it becomes more serious. Please seek help immediately
                        if you have:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>High fever and chills.</li>
                        <li>Pain in your back or side.</li>

            <section>
                <h2>What Causes a UTI?</h2>
                <p>UTIs occur when germs (typically bacteria like E. coli) enter the urinary system. These bacteria
                    usually live in the bowel but can cause problems if they travel to the urethra.</p>
                <p>Common causes include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hygiene Habits:</strong> Wiping from "back to front" can move bacteria toward the
                        urethra.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sexual Activity:</strong> Sex can move bacteria near the urethra.</li>
                    <li><strong>Holding Urine:</strong> Waiting too long to go to the bathroom allows bacteria to grow.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Dehydration:</strong> Not drinking enough water prevents your body from flushing out
                        germs naturally.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Who is Most at Risk?</h2>
                <p>Anyone can get a UTI, but some people are more likely to get them than others:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Women:</strong> Women have a shorter urethra, making it easier for bacteria to reach the
                        bladder.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pregnant Women:</strong> Changes in the body during pregnancy increase infection risk.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>People with Diabetes:</strong> Higher blood sugar or a weaker immune system can increase
                        risk.</li>
                    <li><strong>Menopause:</strong> Hormonal changes can lead to dryness and a higher risk of infection.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Kidney Stones:</strong> Stones can block the flow of urine, trapping bacteria inside.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                <h2>Diagnosis and Treatment</h2>
                <p>If you have symptoms, it is important to see a doctor at Maria Hospital.</p>

                <h3>How we diagnose it</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Urine Test:</strong> You will pee into a cup so our lab can check for bacteria.</li>
                    <li><strong>Urine Culture:</strong> This tells us exactly which bacteria is causing the infection so
                        we can choose the right medicine.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How we treat it</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Antibiotics:</strong> These medicines kill the bacteria. <em>Note: You must finish all
                            your pills, even if you feel better, to stop the infection from coming back.</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Pain Relievers:</strong> We may prescribe medicine to stop the burning sensation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fluids:</strong> We will ask you to drink plenty of water to flush your system.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Prevention: How to Stay Healthy?</h2>
                <p>You can lower your chances of getting a UTI by following these simple tips:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Drink Water:</strong> Aim for 6 to 8 glasses a day.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wipe Correctly:</strong> Always wipe from front to back after using the toilet.</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't "Hold It":</strong> Go to the bathroom when you feel the urge and empty your
                        bladder completely.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gentle Hygiene:</strong> Wear breathable cotton underwear and avoid harsh soaps or
                        sprays in the genital area.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sexual Hygiene:</strong> Peeing right after sex helps clear bacteria away.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>When should you see a doctor?</h2>
