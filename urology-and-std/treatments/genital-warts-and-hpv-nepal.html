                    Noticing changes in your body, especially in private areas, can be worrying. However, it is
                    important to know that you are not alone. <strong>Human Papillomavirus (HPV)</strong> is one of the
                    most common infections worldwide, and we see many cases here in Kathmandu, Nepal.

                    A diagnosis of genital warts or HPV can feel stressful, but open communication and partner support
                    make a big difference. With proper medical treatment and guidance, HPV is manageable and most people
                    continue to live healthy, normal lives.

                <h2>What Are Genital Warts?</h2>
                <p>
                    Genital warts are soft growths that appear on the skin around the genitals or anus. They are caused
                    by the HPV virus. While the idea of a virus sounds scary, it is helpful to know that the types of
                    HPV that cause warts are usually "low-risk." This means they generally do not cause cancer.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2>Signs and Symptoms to Watch For</h2>
                <p>
                    Genital warts might appear weeks, months, or even years after contact with the virus. Sometimes, the
                    virus is "silent" and shows no symptoms at all. However, if symptoms do appear, look out for:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Small Bumps:</strong> These can be skin-colored, grey, or red.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cauliflower Shape:</strong> Irregular clusters of warts that look like a small
                        cauliflower.</li>
                    <li><strong>Location:</strong> In women, they may appear on the vulva, cervix, or anus. In men, they
                        often appear on the penis, scrotum, or anus.</li>
                    <li><strong>Discomfort:</strong> While usually painless, they can sometimes cause itching, burning,
                        or bleeding during intercourse.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If you notice any unusual lumps or changes, a <strong>private doctor consultation</strong>
                    is the
                    best way to get answers.
                </p>

                <figcaption>
                    Genital warts are caused by certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV). They often appear as soft,
                    raised, cauliflower‑like growths on the genital or anal skin. Although usually low‑risk, proper
                    medical evaluation and treatment are important to remove warts, reduce symptoms, and limit spread to
                    partners.

            <section>
                <h2>How Does It Spread?</h2>
                <p>HPV is highly contagious. It spreads primarily through skin-to-skin contact during vaginal, anal, or
                    oral sex.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No fluids required:</strong> Unlike some other infections, HPV passes just through
                        touching infected skin.</li>
                    <li><strong>No visible signs needed:</strong> A person can pass the virus even if they don't have
                        visible warts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Myth buster:</strong> You typically <em>cannot</em> get genital warts from toilet seats,
                        towels, or cutlery.</li>

                <figcaption>
                    Genital warts caused by HPV can appear in both women and men, often as soft, raised,
                    cauliflower‑like growths on the genitals or surrounding skin. They may occur in clusters or as
                    individual lesions. Early medical evaluation helps confirm the diagnosis and allows safe, effective
                    treatment to remove warts and reduce spread.

                <h2>Diagnosis: How We Check for HPV</h2>
                <p>
                    At Maria Hospital, our priority is your comfort and privacy. A
                    <strong>diagnosis</strong> is usually quick and straightforward:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Visual Exam:</strong> Our doctors can often diagnose warts simply by looking at them
                        during a physical <strong>health checkup</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Acetowhite Test:</strong> Sometimes, a mild vinegar solution is used to make the
                        infected tissue turn white, making it easier to see.</li>
                    <li><strong>Biopsy:</strong> In rare cases, a tiny piece of tissue may be sent to a lab to be sure.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Pap Smears:</strong> For women, routine Pap tests are essential to screen for cervical
                        health, though they check for cell changes rather than visible warts.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Safe and Effective Treatment Options</h2>
                <p>
                    While the virus itself doesn't have a cure, the warts can be removed. It is very important
                    <strong>not</strong> to use over-the-counter wart removers from a medical shop, as these can damage
                    sensitive skin.
                </p>
                <p>Your doctor at Maria Hospital may recommend:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Prescription Creams:</strong> Medications like Imiquimod or Podofilox that boost your
                        immune system or stop wart growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cryotherapy (Freezing):</strong> Using liquid nitrogen to freeze the wart so it falls
                        off.</li>
                    <li><strong>Electrocautery:</strong> Using a gentle electric current to remove the wart.</li>
                    <li><strong>Laser Therapy:</strong> Used for warts that are difficult to treat.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Can HPV Be Prevented?</h2>
                <p>Yes, you can lower your risk significantly:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Vaccination:</strong> The HPV vaccine (like Gardasil 9) is safe and highly recommended.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Condoms:</strong> Using condoms helps lower the risk, though it doesn't provide 100%
                        protection since the virus lives on skin.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Smoking weakens the immune system. Quitting smoking helps your body
                        fight off the virus naturally.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>A Note on Pregnancy and Cancer</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cancer Risk:</strong> The HPV types that cause genital warts (types 6 and 11) rarely
                        lead to cancer. However, regular screenings are still important for overall health.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pregnancy:</strong> Most women with HPV have healthy pregnancies and babies. C-sections
                        are generally not required unless warts block the birth canal.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>When Should You See a Doctor?</h2>
                <p>
                    If you or your partner notice bumps, itching, or any discomfort in the genital area, do not wait.
                    While it can feel embarrassing, genital warts are a very common medical condition that we treat
                    regularly in Kathmandu, Nepal. Early diagnosis leads to faster relief and peace of mind.
