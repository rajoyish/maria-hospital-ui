                    Non‑gonococcal urethritis (NGU) is a common and treatable infection
                    of the urethra. With timely diagnosis, proper antibiotic treatment,
                    and partner care, most people recover fully and can return to a
                    healthy, comfortable life.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Urethritis</strong> means the urine tube is inflamed or
                        swollen.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Non-gonococcal</strong> means the infection is caused by
                        germs <em>other than</em> Gonorrhea.

                    It is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) in men,

                <h2>What Causes NGU?</h2>
                <p>
                    Most of the time, NGU is passed through sexual contact. However,
                    there are other causes too.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Bacteria:</strong> The most common cause is a bacteria
                        called <em>Chlamydia</em>. Another common cause is
                        <em>Mycoplasma</em>.

                    <li>

                        other viruses can sometimes cause it.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Non-Sexual Causes:</strong>
                        <a href="/treatments/urinary-tract-infections-uti-nepal">Urinary tract infections (UTIs)</a>,
                        injury to the private parts, or irritation from medical tubes

                        <strong>Unknown Causes:</strong> Sometimes, no specific germ is

                <p>
                    Symptoms usually show up 1 to 3 weeks after infection. However,
                    <strong>many people have no symptoms at all</strong> but can still
                    pass the infection to others.

                    <li>

                        discharge, pelvic pain, or discomfort during sex. Because signs
                        are easily missed or confused with other conditions, timely

                    <li>
                        <strong>Examine:</strong> Look for visible signs of inflammation

                    <li>
                        <strong>Test:</strong> Take a urine sample or a gentle swab to

                <h2>Treatment Options</h2>
                <p>
                    The good news is that NGU is curable.
                    Treatment typically involves antibiotics to kill
                    the bacteria.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Medication:</strong> Doctors usually prescribe antibiotics
                        like Doxycycline (for 7 days) or Azithromycin (a single dose or
                        short course).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Finish Your Medicine:</strong> Even if the pain stops, you
                        <strong>must</strong> finish all your pills to ensure the
                        infection is fully gone.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Treat Your Partner:</strong> Your sexual partner(s) must
                        be tested and treated at the same time, or you might pass the
                        infection back and forth.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>No Sex During Treatment:</strong> Avoid sex for at least 7
                        days until treatment is finished and symptoms are gone.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What if it comes back?</h3>
                <p>
                    If symptoms return, it might be because the bacteria were resistant
                    to the medicine, or you were re-infected. In this case, return to
                    Maria Hospital immediately for a follow-up. We may
                    need to prescribe a different antibiotic.

                <p>
                    If left untreated, NGU can lead to serious health problems in

                        <strong>In Men:</strong> It can cause painful swelling of the
