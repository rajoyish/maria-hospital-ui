                Living in Kathmandu in Nepal, we often ignore minor aches and pains,
                but urinary health is something you should never overlook. A bladder
                infection, medically known as <strong>cystitis</strong>, is very
                common. It happens when your bladder becomes irritated or swollen.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                While these infections can be painful and uncomfortable, the good news
                is that they are highly treatable. With the right doctor consultation
                and care at Maria Hospital, you can feel better quickly.

                    A bladder infection (cystitis) occurs when bacteria travel through
                    the urinary tract and infect the bladder. Understanding how the
                    kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra work together helps explain
                    symptoms like burning urination, urgency, and lower abdominal
                    discomfort.

                <h2>What Causes a Bladder Infection?</h2>
                <p>
                    Most bladder infections happen when bacteria (germs) enter your body
                    and travel up to the bladder.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Bacteria:</strong> The most common cause is E. coli
                        bacteria, which usually lives harmlessly in the gut but causes
                        trouble if it gets into the urinary tract.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Other factors:</strong> Sometimes, fungi can cause
                        infections, especially in people with diabetes or those who have
                        recently used antibiotics.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Who Is Most at Risk?</h2>
                <p>
                    Anyone can get a bladder infection, but some people need to be extra
                    careful:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Women:</strong> Women get them more often than men because
                        of their anatomy. About half of all women will have one at some
                        point.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Older Adults:</strong> Changes in the body as we age can
                        increase risk.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>People with Diabetes:</strong> High sugar levels in urine
                        can help bacteria grow, making health checkups vital for
                        diabetics.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Men with Prostate Issues:</strong> An enlarged prostate
                        can stop the bladder from emptying fully, trapping bacteria
                        inside.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Common Symptoms to Watch For</h2>
                <p>
                    How do you know if you need a diagnosis? Symptoms can start
                    suddenly. Look out for:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>A strong urge to urinate:</strong> Even if you just went.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Burning sensation:</strong> Pain or burning when you pass
                        urine.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Cloudy or bloody urine:</strong> The color may look
                        different than usual.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Strong smell:</strong> Urine may have a foul odor.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Discomfort:</strong> Pressure or cramping in your lower
                        belly or back.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="bg-warning/10 border-warning border-l-4 p-3">
                    <strong>Important Note for Seniors:</strong> In older adults,
                    typical symptoms like burning might not happen. Instead, look for
                    confusion, fever, or just feeling generally unwell.

                <h2>Diagnosis and Treatment at Maria Hospital</h2>
                <p>
                    If you have these symptoms, do not wait. A simple doctor
                    consultation is the first step to feeling better.
                </p>

                <h3>How We Diagnose It</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Urinalysis:</strong> A quick test to check your urine for
                        signs of infection.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Urine Culture:</strong> If needed, we send a sample to the
                        lab to find out exactly which bacteria is causing the problem so
                        we can choose the best medicine.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Effective Treatment</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Antibiotics:</strong> Doctors usually prescribe oral
                        antibiotics to kill the bacteria. You often feel better within 24
                        to 48 hours, but you must finish the full course of medicine.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Pain Relief:</strong> We can provide medication to soothe
                        the burning feeling while the antibiotics start working.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Hydration:</strong> We encourage drinking plenty of fluids
                        to help flush the germs out.
                    </li>

                <p>You can protect yourself with these healthy habits:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Drink Water:</strong> Staying hydrated is key, especially
                        in our climate. It helps wash bacteria out of your system.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Hygiene:</strong> Women should always wipe from front to
                        back to stop bacteria from spreading.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Post-Activity Care:</strong> Emptying your bladder after
                        sexual activity helps flush away germs.

                <p>
                    Most bladder infections are easily cured. However, if untreated, the
                    infection can spread to the kidneys, which is dangerous. Seek
                    immediate help if you have:
