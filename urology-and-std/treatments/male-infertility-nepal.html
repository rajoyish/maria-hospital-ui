                    Trying to start a family is a beautiful journey, but it can be
                    stressful when things don't go as planned. If you have been trying
                    to have a baby for more than a year without success, you are not
                    alone.
                </p>

                <p class="lead">
                    Many couples in <strong>Kathmandu in Nepal</strong> face this
                    challenge. While people often think infertility is only a female
                    issue, the reality is different. In about 50% of cases, the male
                    partner plays a role.

                    a shared condition, and there is hope.

                    Male infertility can be an unexpected and stressful experience for
                    couples trying to start a family. With proper diagnosis and shared
                    support, many causes of male infertility are treatable, offering
                    real hope for parenthood.

                <h2>What are the Signs?</h2>
                <p>
                    The most obvious sign of male infertility is simply not being able
                    to conceive a child. Often, there are no other visible signs.
                    However, you should look out for:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Sexual difficulties:</strong> Trouble with erections or
                        ejaculation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Physical changes:</strong> Pain, swelling, or a lump in
                        the testicle area.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Hormonal signs:</strong> Changes in hair growth or breast
                        tissue.
                    </li>

                <h2>Why Does This Happen?</h2>
                <p>
                    Male fertility is complex. To make a baby, you need healthy sperm
                    that can travel properly. Common causes include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Sperm Issues:</strong> This is the most common cause. You
                        might have a low sperm count, or the sperm might not move
                        correctly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Varicocele:</strong> This is a swelling of the veins that
                        drain the testicle. It raises the temperature in the scrotum and
                        can damage sperm quality.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Infections:</strong> Past infections or sexually
                        transmitted issues can block the passage of sperm.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Lifestyle Factors:</strong> Smoking, heavy alcohol use,
                        and taking steroids for bodybuilding can severely harm your
                        fertility.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Environmental Factors:</strong> Frequent exposure to high
                        heat (like hot tubs) or certain chemicals.

                <h2>How We Diagnose the Problem</h2>
                <p>
                    Diagnosis is the first step toward a solution. We recommend that
                    both partners come for a <strong>doctor consultation</strong> at the
                    same time. When you visit us for a <strong>health checkup</strong>,
                    here is what to expect:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Medical History & Exam:</strong> Your doctor will ask
                        about your lifestyle and history and perform a simple physical
                        check.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Semen Analysis:</strong> This is the most important test.
                        We analyze a sample in our lab to check the count, shape, and
                        movement of your sperm.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Blood Tests:</strong> We check your hormone levels to see
                        if your body is producing sperm correctly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Ultrasound:</strong> If needed, we use imaging to look for
                        blockages or swollen veins.
                    </li>

                <h2>Effective Treatments Available in Nepal</h2>
                <p>
                    The good news is that many causes of male infertility can be fixed.
                    At <strong>Maria Hospital</strong>, we offer a range of options for
                    <strong>diagnosis</strong> and <strong>treatment</strong>:
                </p>

                <h3>1. Lifestyle Changes</h3>
                <p>
                    Simple changes can make a big difference in your sperm health:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Quit smoking and limit alcohol.</li>
                    <li>Maintain a healthy weight.</li>
                    <li>
                        Avoid hot environments (like saunas) to keep testicles cool.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Medical and Surgical Help</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Medicine:</strong> Antibiotics can treat infections, and
                        hormone therapy can boost sperm production.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Surgery:</strong> A simple procedure can fix swollen veins
                        (varicocele) or repair blockages.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    We understand that infertility can cause stress, depression, and
                    strain on a relationship. These feelings are normal. We encourage
                    you to talk openly with your partner and seek support.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Early <strong>diagnosis</strong> can lead to successful
                    <strong>treatment</strong>. Don't let fear stop you from starting
                    your family.
