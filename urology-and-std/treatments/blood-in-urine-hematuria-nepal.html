                Seeing blood in your urine can be a very scary experience. It is
                natural to feel worried, but please remember: you are not alone. This
                is a common condition that doctors see frequently.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
                While it can sometimes signal a serious issue, in many cases, the
                cause is minor and easily treatable. At
                <strong>Maria Hospital</strong>, located in Kathmandu, Nepal, we are
                dedicated to helping you understand your symptoms and providing the
                right care.

                    Hematuria occurs when blood cells leak into the urinary tract,
                    potentially turning urine pink, red, or tea-colored. While some
                    causes are benign, visible blood in the urine should always be
                    evaluated by a medical professional to rule out serious conditions
                    like infections, stones, or underlying disease.

                <h2>What Is Hematuria?</h2>
                <p>
                    "Hematuria" is the medical term for blood in the urine. It means
                    that the kidneys or another part of your urinary tract (bladder,
                    tubes, etc.) are allowing blood cells to leak into your urine.
                </p>

                <p>There are two main types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Visible (Gross) Hematuria:</strong> You can see this with
                        your naked eye. Your urine may look pink, bright red, or brownish
                        (like tea or cola).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Invisible (Microscopic) Hematuria:</strong> The urine
                        looks normal to you, but a small amount of blood is found when a
                        doctor tests your urine under a microscope during a health
                        checkup.

                <h2>Signs and Symptoms to Watch For</h2>
                <p>
                    The most obvious sign is a change in the color of your urine.
                    However, depending on the cause, you might also feel:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pain or burning when you pass urine.</li>
                    <li>Frequent urination or a sudden, strong urge to go.</li>
                    <li>Back or side pain (often linked to kidney issues).</li>
                    <li>Fever or chills, which usually suggests an infection.</li>
                    <li>Blood clots in the urine, which can be painful.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                <h2>Common Causes of Blood in Urine</h2>
                <p>
                    Blood can come from anywhere in your urinary system. Common causes
                    seen by doctors in Nepal include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong><a href="/treatments/urinary-tract-infections-uti-nepal">Urinary Tract Infections
                                (UTIs)</a>:</strong> Bacteria enter
                        the bladder or kidneys, causing infection, pain, and bleeding.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Kidney or Bladder Stones:</strong> Minerals in the urine
                        form hard stones. When these stones move or get stuck, they cause
                        severe pain and bleeding.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Enlarged Prostate:</strong> In older men, the prostate
                        gland can grow and press on the urinary tube, causing bleeding.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Trauma:</strong> An injury from an accident or sports
                        contact.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Medications:</strong> Some blood thinners or antibiotics
                        can increase bleeding risks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Cancer:</strong> Though less common, visible blood can be
                        a sign of kidney or bladder cancer.
                        <em>Note: This is often painless, so do not ignore blood just
                            because it doesn't hurt.</em>
                    </li>

                <h3>Did you know?</h3>
                <p>
                    Not all red urine is blood. Foods like beets or blackberries, and
                    certain medicines, can turn urine pink. However, it is always safer
                    to get a doctor consultation to be sure.

                <h2>Diagnosis: How We Find the Cause</h2>
                <p>
                    At Maria Hospital, we use advanced technology to get an accurate
                    diagnosis. Your checkup may include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Urinalysis:</strong> A simple test to check your urine for
                        infection, red blood cells, and protein.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Medical History:</strong> Your doctor will ask about your
                        health history and risk factors (like smoking).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Imaging (Ultrasound or CT Scan):</strong> These safe scans
                        help us "see" inside your body to spot stones or tumors.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Cystoscopy:</strong> If needed, a doctor uses a tiny
                        camera tube to look directly inside your bladder.
                    </li>

                <p>
                    Your treatment plan depends entirely on what is causing the
                    bleeding:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>For Infections:</strong> We prescribe antibiotics to clear
                        the bacteria.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>For Kidney Stones:</strong> Small stones may pass with
                        water; larger ones might need sound-wave therapy or minor
                        procedures to remove them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>For Prostate Issues:</strong> Medication can help shrink
                        the prostate.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>For Cancer:</strong> Our specialist team will create a
                        comprehensive plan involving surgery or therapy.
